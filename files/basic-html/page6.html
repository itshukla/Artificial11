               A question is a phrase or word that asks for information or is used to test someone's knowledge. We always use a
               question mark (?) at the end of questions. In our daily interactions with other people, we often have to ask questions to
               get information. Asking the right questions can help us get the information we want.
               Questions that can be answered with ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ are called closed questions. This is because response options are
               limited or closed. For example, when we asked, “Are you hungry?”, the answer can be ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.
               Sometimes when we ask a question, we expect a more detailed answer. For example, when we ask, “What do you want
               to eat?", the answer could be: "I want to eat a mango". These are called open questions because their answer options
               are neither limited nor closed.                                  460  Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI
