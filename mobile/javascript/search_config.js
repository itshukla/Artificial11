Asking the right questions can help us get the information we want.                Questions that can be answered with ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ are called closed questions. This is because response options are                limited or closed. For example, when we asked, “Are you hungry?”, the answer can be ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.                Sometimes when we ask a question, we expect a more detailed answer. For example, when we ask, “What do you want                to eat?\", the answer could be: \"I want to eat a mango\". These are called open questions because their answer options                are neither limited nor closed.                                  460  Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI                                                                                    Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI                                                                                 460                                            Communication Skills-III  35","5.

These machines, then, can process vast amounts of data than humans can, and several times               faster. However, AI can go across all disciplines to change the world for the better– from creating new healthcare                solutions, to designing hospitals of the future, improving farming and our food supply, helping refugees acclimate to               new environments, improving educational resources and access, and even cleaning our oceans, air, and water supply.               The potential for humans to improve the world through AI is endless, as long as we know how to use it.                 LEARNING OUTCOMES               In this course, the students will develop knowledge, skills and values to understand AI and its implications for our society               and the world and to use AI to solve authentic problems, now and in the future. The students will engage with a host of               multi-media online resources, as well as hands-on activities and sequence of learning experiences.                The following are the main objectives of the course:               1.     Develop informed citizens with an understanding of AI and the skills to think critically and knowledgeably about                    the implications of AI for society and the world.                2.     Develop engaged citizens with a rigorous understanding of how AI can be harnessed to improve life and the world                    we live in.                3.     Stimulate interest and prepare students for further study to take up careers as AI scientists and developers to solve                    complex real world problems.","SCHEME OF UNITS                  This course is a planned sequence of instructions consisting of units meant for developing employability and vocational                  competencies of students opting for skill subject along with other education subjects.

Everyone needs it and wants it, but what exactly is                  communication?                   In this unit, we will learn about communication, methods of communication and different types of communication styles.                  Next, you will learn about basics of writing styles.                          Communication—An Introduction                    Communication is the ‘sharing’ of information between two or more people or within a group to achieve a common                  understanding. The word ‘communication’ comes from the Latin word ‘communicare’, which means to share. The ability to                  clearly communicate and share thoughts, feelings and ideas will help you in all your dealings with others. Speaking more                  than one language can help you communicate well with people around the world. Communication skills are required to:                  •  Inform: For example, announcing the latest assessment guidelines given by CBSE.                   •  Influence: For example, negotiating with a shopkeeper for a discount.                  •  Express feelings: For example, say that you are enthusiastic about your success or an assigned task.                   The Communication Process                  Communication is the process of transmitting an appropriate message from a sender to a receiver through a transmission                  channel in a proper format. The communication process helps in sharing of a common meaning between the sender and                  the receiver. Let us study all these elements in detail.                  •  Sender: Can be any person, group or organisation that initiates the process of communication. The sender’s knowledge,                    experiences and skills influence the quality of the message.                                                                                        Communication Skills-III  19","• Ideas/Message: This message can be in the form of an idea or any information a sender wishes to convey.                  • Encoding: Sending a message in the form of text, signs, symbols or any other visual that the receiver has to decode                  to know its actual meaning.                                                       Feedback            Sender                                            Decoding                                  Ideas/Message                                                              Elements of                                                           Communication                                               Receiver                              Encoding                                                          Communication                                                             Channel                   • Communication Channel: This is the medium used to deliver a message. So, now we can send messages through                  e-mail, voice mail, social websites, etc.                  • Receiver: Can be any person, group or organisation that  interprets the message  conveyed by a sender. Also  a                  receiver needs to be smart enough to understand exact meaning of the message sent.                  • Decoding: The receiver has to extract the meaning from the text, signs or symbols sent by the sender and find out                  its actual meaning.                  • Feedback: It is the process in which the receiver and the sender ensure that they understand each other correctly.                         Perspectives in Communication                Perspectives are ideas, beliefs, or established ways of thinking that influence our perceptions and relationships. These               perspectives  might  sometimes  obstruct  efficient  communication.  Others  may  also  have  preconceived  assumptions               about you, which might influence how you engage with them. For example, if you consider a coworker uncooperative,               you may misread their neutral actions as obstructive, leading to misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.               These biases highlight the significance of being aware of our opinions and seeking clarity in our relationships.                                                  20      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Factors Affecting Perspectives in Communication                  Barriers may prevent clear communication and understanding. Some of these barriers are listed as follows:                         Factor                                  How the factor can be a barrier                                     Language can be a barrier to communication, especially when used incorrectly, unfamiliarly, or                  Language          without information. For example, language can be a barrier to interaction between Indians who                                    speak Hindi and Spaniards who speak Spanish.                                     Judging individuals or situations based on their appearance. For example, a man dressed in old,                  Visual Perception                                    worn-out clothes is considered poor.                                    Allowing our previous experience to interfere with our ability to understand and communicate                  Past Experience   accurately. For example, \"This shopkeeper cheated me the last time. I will no longer shop from                                    him.”                   Prejudice         Fixed beliefs like \"No one in my class listens to me\" can hinder open communication in class.                                     Emotions, including lack of interest or trust, can impact communication. For instance, “I'm sad.                  Feelings                                    Don’t feel like talking.”                                    Noise or disturbances prevent communication. For example, conversing while loud music  is                  Environment                                    playing on the street.                                     Communication can be challenging due to personal feelings, behaviours, and thought patterns                  Personal factors                                    like fear, and poor confidence.                                    Signs can have diverse meanings in different cultures, such as showing a thumb, which may imply                  Cultural factors                                    ‘good job’ to some, but be offensive to others.                           7Cs of Communication                   Communication is a  two-way  exchange  of information,  i.e.,  give  and  take.  Speaking  and  writing  to  someone are                  examples of giving information. Reading and listening to someone are examples of taking information.

Let us understand each one.                Verbal Communication               Verbal communication is the exchange of information using words.               This  is  what most people use as a communication method. Verbal               communication is important. If you don't use the right words, you'll be               confused and you won't be able to convey your message. The types of               verbal communication are:               •    Oral  or  Spoken  Communication: This type  of communication                   takes place during face-to-face conversations, group discussions,                   telephone calls, and any other circumstances where spoken words                   are used to communicate your thoughts, present ideas and share                   information.                      22      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","•  Written Communication: It refers to the process of conveying your message through written language.                                           Advantages of Verbal Communication                  Some of the advantages of verbal communication are:                  •  Saves a lot of time and money.                  •  This mode of communication is convenient to use since it is quick in obtaining feedback from receiver.                   •   In case of written communication, the information conveyed can be saved for future use such as for production of                     evidence.                   •  Good oratory skills are very useful for persuasion or convincing especially in marketing business.                   Disadvantages of Verbal Communication                  Some of the disadvantages of verbal communication are:                  •  Verbal Communication becomes very difficult in case of language barrier or noise between sender and receiver.                   •   In case of oral communication, long messages are difficult to memorise and it might become confusing. Although                     written communication may overcome this problem but it might become boring in case of long piece of text.                   •   It is necessary to think before you speak since words once spoken cannot be taken back. This might hurt sentiments                     of others.                    Non-Verbal Communication                  Non-verbal communication is the transmission of a message without using words. We send signals and messages to                  others through our expressions, gestures and body posture.

Disadvantages of Non-verbal Communication               Some of the disadvantages of non-verbal communication are:                •  Lack of formality               •  Culture oriented               •  No explanation of messages                •  Ambiguity               •  Long conversations are not possible                               Brainy Fact                          • We can tell a true smile, also called a Duchenne smile, from a fake by looking into a person's eyes.                        • In the United States, it's normal to smile at a stranger; it is seen as a warm and welcoming sign.

Saying No-Refusal Skills                 One of the most important ways of being assertive is to learn to say ‘NO’ without offending the other person. Have you ever               encountered a situation where you wanted to say ‘No’ but didn't do so, as you didn’t want to sound rude or upset the other               person? It is often difficult to say no to family, friends, colleagues, and bosses. This may be because of a variety of reasons:               •  You may not want to annoy or offend the other person.               •  You may not want to enter into an argument.               •  You may fear being excluded from the group or team.

It will also help                  others to understand your words easily.

Sounds can be divided into consonants and vowels. The first can be characterised by 1) place, 2) mode                  of pronunciation and 3) voice. The English alphabet has 26 letters from A to Z. However, each of these letters can be                  pronounced differently in different words. We write words in English language using 26 letters. However, while speaking                  English, more than 26 sounds are used. For this reason, the spelling of a word does not always match its pronunciation.                  Let us understand the sounds we use. All English words are made of three basic types of sounds—vowels, diphthongs                  (combination sound of two vowels) and consonants. Let us see some examples:                                           vowel              diphthongs          consonants                                           sit                count               think                                           cat                cheer               pull                                                                                         Communication Skills-III  27","#Experiential Learning                           Video Session                      Scan the QR code or visit the following link to watch the video: 44 sounds in English                      alphabet | 44 phonemes | how to pronounce all English sounds | 44 phonics sound                      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41m-igTNUkE                      After watching the video, answer the following questions:                      1.

Communication Styles                A ‘style’ of communication includes verbal as well as non-verbal skills. If you use the correct communication style, your               communication will be more effective because others can clearly understand your words and answer you better. There               are mainly four styles of communication:                                  Passive/Submissive                                 Passive Aggressive                        Emotionally dishonest, indirect, denies self        Emotionally dishonest, self-enhancing at                                       needs                                          others' expense                                          Aggressive                                         Assertive                       Inappropriately honest, blaming, attacking       Appropriately honest, expressive, self-confident                 Let us learn bout them in detail.                Passive/Submissive Communication               This communication style is mostly practiced by introvert people. This involves:                •  Being submissive and not expressing your opinion so as to avoid conflict.               •  Staying quiet despite being criticised.               •  Being apologetic even when not at fault.               •  Uncomfortable body language introverted of confidence.                There are various disadvantages of being passive:                •  Projects lack of confidence and self-esteem.               •  Causes frustration and anxiety in the long run.                      28      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","•  Fail to express their feelings.                  •  Exhibits poor body language and no eye contact.                    Aggressive Communication                  This communication style involves:                  •  Using strong language and being hurtful to others.                  •  Blaming and not accepting your faults.                  •  Controlling and dominating others.                  •   Not caring for other’s views and being disrespectful.                   There are various disadvantages of being aggressive:                   •  Makes you verbally or physically abusive.                  •  Makes you intimidating and rude person.                  •  Prevents you from becoming mature, understanding and amiable person.                  •  You fail to listen to others, this breaks communication.                    Passive Aggressive Communication                  This communication style involves acting passive on the surface while showing aggression in a subtle way. Characteristics                  of such a communication style are:                  •  Muttering to oneself rather than telling or sharing the issue.                  •  Appearing sweet on the outside whereas in reality being resentful.                  •  Trying to get your own way without taking responsibility.                  •  Being sarcastic and untruthful.                   •   Your body language and facial expressions don’t match with what you want to portray. Example, smiling despite                     being angry.                   There are various disadvantages of being passively aggressive:                  •  Eventually not getting the desired results from your communication since real issues are never addressed.                  •  Struggle to voice your opinions despite being aware of them.                  •  Constant suppression of true emotions, thus feeling persistent unhappiness.                    Assertive Communication                  As you can see from the above figure, being assertive is the most effective communication style. This involves:                  •  Expressing your opinion and desires without ignoring others,                   •  Giving others due respect,                   •  Accepting others’ opinions,                  •  Discovering a balance between your needs and others’ needs.                   There are various advantages to being assertive:                  •  Builds confidence and self-esteem,                   •  Prevents you from doing or saying something that you might regret later,                  •  Makes you and others feel optimistic,                                                                                          Communication Skills-III  29","•  Makes it easy for you to help everyone express their thoughts,               •  Enhances confidence and makes you a better communicator.

It's not just about using the right words; it's about making sure your body               language conveys the right message. The central part of assertiveness is positive thinking.

A paragraph works around a common idea. If you want to write for another                  idea, create a new paragraph. For example, if you're writing about colleges, the first paragraph may contain sentences                  referring to names, locations, and other details about different colleges in a particular city.

Greetings differ when you meet your colleagues at work or meet               friends. Similarly, there are many ways to say goodbye when leaving for the day. Greeting also depends on who we are               talking to and even the time of the day. Overall, greetings help us start a nice conversation.                Types of Greetings               There are two methods of greetings as follows:               Formal Greetings: You formally greet someone if you do not know the person. It is used to greet an elderly person,               or people with whom we have a formal relationship such as a teacher or a client. This is used more often in schools,               colleges, offices, meetings, etc.               Informal Greetings: Informal greetings are used when you are talking to friends, family or when you know the person               very well.

You will need to “introduce yourself” by telling                  them about yourself. You usually start by saying your name. Then you can talk about other things, such as what you do,                  your age, where you live, or even things or activities that you like or dislike. For all these sentences, you will use nouns                  and verbs.                   Introducing yourself to Others                  The following is a way to introduce yourself (talk about your likes, dislikes, strengths and weaknesses) - Hello, my name is                  Samarth, and I'm a grade 11 student with a passion for dancing and listening to music. I find joy and relaxation in these                  activities, which help me express myself creatively. While I excel in public speaking and enjoy engaging with audiences,                  I must admit that I have a short temper. On the flip side, math is not my favorite subject, and I find hot summers quite                  uncomfortable. However, I absolutely love spending time at the beach, where I can unwind and enjoy the serene beauty                  of the ocean.                                  Brainy Fact                         In New Zealand, people greet each other by pressing their noses (and sometimes forehead). This is                       referred to as “sharing of breath” by New Zealand’s indigenous Mori people. The greeting represents the                       sacred reception of a visitor into Mori culture and is used during powhiri (Mori welcoming ceremonies),                       though the honour is not offered to everyone.                      Filling a Form                  Instead of speaking, you may be required to fill out a form with information about yourself. A form is a written or printed                  paper that has blank spaces for information. Filling out a normal form involves numerous steps to ensure that the                  essential information is delivered correctly:                  1.  Read Instructions: Please read any instructions provided at the beginning of the form.                  2.  Fill in Personal Details: Provide your full name, date of birth, and contact information.                  3.  Provide Address Details: Enter your current residential address and any former addresses, if applicable.                  4.   Complete Specific Sections: Depending on the form's purpose, fill out sections about education, employment, or                     other relevant information.                   5.  Review and Correct: Check all of the information you submitted to ensure there are no errors or omissions.                  6.  Sign and Date: Sign and date the paperwork as needed.                           Asking Questions                   A question is a phrase or word that asks for information or is used to test someone's knowledge. We always use a                  question mark (?) at the end of questions. In our daily interactions with other people, we often have to ask questions to                  get information. Asking the right questions can help us get the information we want.                  Questions that can be answered with ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ are called closed questions. This is because response options are                  limited or closed. For example, when we ask, “Are you hungry?”, the answer can be ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.                  Sometimes when we ask a question, we expect a more detailed answer. For example, when we ask, “What do you want                  to eat?\", the answer could be: \"I want to eat a mango.\" These are called open questions because their answer options                  are neither limited nor closed.

There are also other auxiliary verbs (called modal verbs) such as ‘can’, ‘may’, ‘should’, etc., that               indicate the potential or need. One way to create a closed question is to take a sentence that does not contain the words               above and put those words before the subject. For example, \"Do you like eating ice cream?\"               Some examples of close-ended questions with helping verbs are:               •  She cooks lunch.                 Does she cook lunch?               •  He can draw a cartoon.           Can he draw a cartoon?               In some cases, the subject and verb positions in the sentence are swapped to create a closed question. You can use the               above given method for sentences that already have auxiliary verbs. Examples:               They were sweeping the floor.       Were they sweeping the floor?               You can work with me.               Can you work with me?               Similarly, some questions are said to be open because the answer options are not restricted or closed. They need to be               answered with more information than simply saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’. You can create an open question using interrogative               words, such as what, why, who, how, when, and where.               Open-ended questions                Answer               What did you do in the morning?     I went to school.               How did you travel?                 I travelled by metro.                         Discussing Family                How large or small is your family? What if someone asks about your family? Can you introduce all members of your               family in English? Learn some words to help you introduce your family and how you relate to them.               In English,               •  Mother’s parents are called maternal grandparents (grandfather and grandmother).               •  Father’s parents are called paternal grandparents (grandfather and grandmother).                •  Father’s or mother's sister is called aunt.               •  Father’s or mother’s brother is called uncle.               •  All children of your aunt and uncle are called cousins.                •   Members of the husband's or wife's family are referred to as ‘in-laws’. For example, husband's brother and sister                   would be his wife's brother-in-law and sister-in-law respectively.                •  Similarly, the wife’s brother and sister would be brother-in-law and sister-in-law of her husband respectively.               Recall that  the words that  describe a noun  or  pronoun  are called adjectives. The  type  of adjective that  describes               relationships or properties is called possessive adjectives. Possessive adjectives can be used to indicate the relationship               between things and their owners.                      36      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Examples:                  •  My skirt is blue.                  •  Her cat drank the milk.                  •  Mr. Verma’s car broke down.                   Observe these lines as Sonali talks about her family. Notice the relation words that have been underlined.                  My name is Sonali. I have a large family. My mother is a banker. My father works in an IT company. My elder sister’s name                  is Sonal and my younger brother’s name is Aryan. I have two aunts and one uncle. Our grandparents stay in Mumbai. I love                  visiting them during the holidays. They have a dog named Bob.

For example, if you use the                  same road to travel to the office every day, then it is your habit.                   A routine is a regular and orderly way to perform an activity at a set time. There are several phrases you can use to                  describe your routine. Some words like daily, normal (or general), always, sometimes, never, etc. can be used to describe                  our habits and routines.                  Habits and Routines – Example of Sonali’s daily routine:                                       Everyday, I get up at 6:30 am.                                        I always brush my teeth first and then take a bath by 6:45 am.                                       I have a glass of milk.                                       I leave for school by 7:10 am. I am never late.                                       I come back from school by 2:30 pm.                                       I always take a bath and wash my school uniform.                                        I have my lunch and then do my homework.                                       I go to play with my friends at 6 pm.                                       I always return by 7:30 pm and help my mother prepare dinner.                                        I have dinner with my family at 8:30 pm.                                       I watch TV after dinner.                                       I go to sleep by 10 pm.                  Sonali’s routine consists of the actions listed above, performed sequentially. She does them every day, in the exact same                  order! Some are habits, such as taking a bath or watching TV, while others are work or chores, such as washing her school                  uniform.                                                                                        Communication Skills-III  37","Words, such as “always,” “never,” and “sometimes,” refer to certain activities. These are known as frequency adverbs.               They describe how frequently something occurs. They help describe habits. Additional examples of similar adverbs are               as follows:                    I go to the mall daily.                   I sometimes go to the mall.                                            Asking for Directions                How do you prepare for traveling to a new location? You ask someone or consult Google Maps. When asking someone,               be nice. Begin by saying ‘excuse me’ or greeting them.               As shown in the list below, specify your destination (e.g., Central School, Aya Nagar, Railway Station, Laxmi Nagar Post               Office, Admission Office within a building) when asking for directions.                  • Excuse me, can you please tell me the way to the Central Bank?                  • Excuse me, which way is the Sector 12, Metro Station?                   • Excuse me, do you know the way to the National Museum?                  • Can you tell me the directions for reaching your home from the Model Town?               Typically, the  other  person will specify the direction,  distance,  and  locations for  taking  turns. If someone asks for               instructions, follow the same procedure. Check your understanding of the directions by repeating them. Before departing,               remember to express gratitude to those who helped you.                Directions using Landmarks               When giving directions, it's helpful to include well-known sights such as bus stops, lakes, bridges, large workplaces, and               schools. To provide instructions based on well-known locations, we employ 'prepositions'. (Tip: Prepositions indicate               position). In this session, we will focus on using position terms to indicate time, rather than other prepositions.

Long answer type questions.                      1.  What are phonetics? Explain in detail.                    Ans.  Phonetics is the study of human sounds and phonology is the systematic classification of sounds in one or more                         specific languages. Sounds can be divided into consonants and vowels. The first can be characterized by 1) place, 2)                         mode of pronunciation and 3) voice. The English alphabet has 26 letters from A to Z. However, each of these letters                         can be pronounced differently in different words. We write words in English language using 26 letters. However,                         while speaking English, more than 26 sounds are used. For this reason, the spelling of a word does not always                         match its pronunciation.                      2.  What are greetings? Define two types of greetings.                    Ans.  There are many ways to greet when you meet someone. Greetings differ when you meet your colleagues at work or                         meet friends. Similarly, there are many ways to say goodbye when leaving for the day. Greeting also depends on who                         we are talking to and even the time of the day. Overall, greetings help us start a nice conversation.                        There are two methods of greetings as follows:                        Formal Greetings: You formally greet someone if you do not know the person. It is used to greet an elderly person,                        or people with whom we have a formal relationship such as a teacher or a client. This is used more often in schools,                        colleges, offices, meetings, etc.                        Informal Greetings: Informal greetings are used when you are talking to friends, family or when you know the                        person very well.                      3.  What is verbal communication? Write any three advantages of it.                    Ans.   Verbal communication is the exchange of information using words. This is what most people use as a communication                         method. Verbal communication is important.

It is important to know who you are.                  Analysing your strengths and weaknesses is helpful. An analysis of strengths and weaknesses begins with knowing and                  understanding yourself first. Let's understand some terms that help with this.

Identity                Identity is a set of behavioural or personal characteristics by which an individual is recognised as a member of a group.               Identity can emerge from a person's citizenship, religion or caste. A person’s identity is a total of his/her opinions, beliefs,               values, likes, dislikes, religion, etc. It is important to know who you are because only then you can measure your strengths               and weaknesses.                Strengths and Weaknesses               Strength or ability is what you do well and are good at. Everyone has strengths. For example, one person can be good               at solving mathematical equations, another has good cooking skills, etc.               Weakness, also known as \"area for improvement\" is what you don't do well and what you're not good at. Everyone has               some weaknesses. For example, a person cannot draw well or panics in a difficult situation, etc.                                           46      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","By understanding ourselves,      Using this information, we       By improving ourselves, we                          we understand what/what           realize how to improve          become more confident.                                 not to do.                      ourselves.

In these cases, you can improve your skills or go a different route. For                  example, you may like badminton (interest), but you may not be good at the game. In this case, you can play just for                  fun, not aim for a badminton career.

Self-motivation is what drives us to achieve our goals, makes               us feel happy and improve the quality of our lives. In other words, it's our ability to do what needs to be done without               someone or something influencing us.                Types of Motivation               There are mainly two types of Intrinsic/Internal and Extrinsic/External motivation. Let us learn about them in detail.                Intrinsic/Internal Motivation               We do things that interest us and give us enjoyment, e.g. Joyita loves to read novels. Inspite of her busy schedule, she               takes out 30 mins every day to read a book.                Extrinsic/External Motivation               We do things because it gives us a reward like money, fame, etc. For example, Rohan practices playing chess every day               because he wants to win the year-end chess championship.                                     For the interest and                                For the outcome                                   enjoyment in doing                                  that will result by                                   the task itself                                     achieving the task                                   •   Enjoyment                                       •   Promotions                                   •  Purpose                                          •  Pay raises                                   •  Growth                                           •  Bonuses                                   •  Curiosity          Internal         External     •  Benefits                                   •  Passion                                          •  Prizes                                   •  Self-expression                                  •  Winning                                                                                       •  Perks                Qualities of Self-Motivated People               Following qualities can be easily recognised in self-motivated people:                                          Energised           Focused         Understand what is   Want to fulfill their                                                                          important            dreams                How to stay self-motivated?                                                                                    #Experiential Learning                           Video Session                       Scan the QR code or visit the following link to watch the video: 5 tips – How to stay                      self-motivated (Personality development and Motivational skills video)                      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGneNpvdwnc                      After watching the video, answer the following question:                      Which tips given in the video do you practice to stay motivated?                             52      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Goal Setting                   Goal setting is a very important factor in your personal and professional life. The process of setting goals in your life                  helps you decide how you want to live your life, where you want to be and what you want to be in the future.                  Goals can be related to several things like money, health, family, education, career, etc. Goals are constantly changing.                  We meet old goals and then establish a new set of goals to achieve. Goals are a set of dreams with an achievable                  deadline. For example, during the second covid wave, many people arranged oxygen cylinders for the covid patients in                  their local areas. Goal setting is finding and listing your goals and then planning how to achieve them. Goal setting helps                  you focus. It enables you to succeed in your career and personal life.

M   Measurable: To ensure you can track progress.                             A   Attainable: Create a goal that is realistic.                             R   Relevant: Ensure your goal aligns with your organisation.                             T   Time-bound: Assign a target date to keep accountability.                    How to make Goals SMART?                         Specific — A clear and explicit goal provides answers to six questions. Who is involved in the goal? What                        do I want to do? Where should I start? When do I start and finish? Which means should I use? Why am I                        doing this?                        Non-example: I want to learn a musical instrument.                        Example: “I want to learn to play the guitar by taking lessons twice a week at the local music school, and                        in six months, I will perform at the school's annual talent show.”                             Measurable — An easily measured objective answers the questions \"How much?\" and \"How many?\" as                        well as \"How do I understand that I have achieved results?\"                        Non-example: “I want to improve my fitness.”                         Example: “I want to increase my bench press by 20 pounds and be able to run 5 kilometres in under 25                        minutes within the next four months.”                                                                                       Self-Management Skills-III   53","Achievable — Breaking down large goals into smaller segments makes them more achievable.                       Bigger Goal: “I want to open my own bakery.”                      Breaking it into smaller goals:                      1. Complete a baking course                      2. Gain work experience in a bakery                      3. Save money for startup costs                       4. Develop a business plan                      5. Secure a location and necessary permits                      6. Open the bakery                         Realistic — A realistic goal is something we want and can work toward to achieve it.                      Non-example: “I will learn a new language fluently in one week.”                       Example: “I will spend one hour every day learning a new language using online resources and practice                      with a language partner to become conversational within six months.”                          Time-bound — A SMART objective should have a timetable, indicating when the goal must be completed.                      This inspires us to take action in order to fully achieve our objectives.                      Non-example: “I want to write a book someday.”                      Example: “I will write 500 words every day and complete the first draft of my novel in six months.”                           Time Management                 Anita has always been lazy. Her mother has tried several times to explain the importance of time. However, Anita never               listens. One day, Anita won an online coding competition and was asked to collect her prize from the organiser’s office               the same day. She, however, didn’t bother and only went to collect her prize the next day. Alas! It was too late, the prize               had no value for her. The value of the prize was only equivalent to movie tickets the previous day.               Time management is the ability to plan and control how you spend your time well and do whatever you want. An               example of good time management skills is to finish your homework immediately after school so that you can watch               TV later or play with your friends.                Time management is a thinking skill that helps you:                  •  get things done on time                   •  make a daily schedule                  •  accurately estimate how long it will take to complete chores                   •  submit assignments and do homework before or on time                  •  don't waste time postponing activities                             54      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Steps for Effective Time Management                  Following steps help in effective time management:                                                                    1.

We prioritize our activities by creating a to-do list and ranking them accordingly. We                  prioritize vital tasks over time-wasting activities such as phone conversations and social media. We identify and record                  where we have spent our time. This allows us to assess the effectiveness of our time management.

The header and footer are used to display information on every page at the same place. For example, if we want                  to display the title and the date at the top of each page, and the page number at the bottom of each page, we can use                  a header, or a footer feature of a word processor.

The market offers               products in the form of goods or services to meet our specific needs. Let us have a look at them, one by one.

In this type of business, you can sell the finished product directly to your customers. For example, Bata makes               shoes; it has several factories where shoes are made. This is an example of a manufacturing company.                                         Trading Business               Trading companies do not manufacture goods or products. They only facilitate the process of getting the finished               product to brought from the production unit to the purchaser or customer. For example, your local pharmacy or chemist               shop sells various medicines manufactured by different companies. It is only involved in the process of procuring the               medicines from pharmacy companies and selling them to customers.                                             78      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Services Business                  A business activity that you can't see, but that benefits the buyer, is called a service business. These activities can include                  traveling, consulting, delivering, cleaning, etc. There is no fixed time for the service, and the service providers respond                  flexibly according to the customer's request. Services do not even require a shop to sell the product. For example,                  customer care services for any product you purchase like a laptop.                                               Values that Make an Entrepreneur Successful                   Every entrepreneur has certain unique qualities that make him successful. Entrepreneurs come in many forms, each with                  distinct traits and business strategies. Here are some common types:                                                                   Innovative                                              Building future                         Passionate                                                Motivated                               Perspective                                                                  Values of                                                                Entrepreneur                                          Challenging                                    Priority                                                   Congruent                           Integrity                                                                   Positive                    The entrepreneur's ability to overcome these doubts determines his ability to succeed. The entrepreneur's values play                  an important role in overcoming these challenges. Let us discuss about some of the values possessed by successful                  entrepreneurs.                    Confidence                  Confidence means believing in yourself and your approach. Confidence helps business owners take the first step to start                  a new business, and then try new things to grow their business. It encourages entrepreneurs to continue even if they                  fail. Confidence also encourages business owners to visit customers and seek feedback on their products or services.                  Feedback helps entrepreneurs further improve and grow their businesses.                    Independence                  Independence  means  the  ability  to  work  alone  and  the  self-confidence  to  make  decisions.  It  is  the  entrepreneur's                  responsibility to decide what kind of work to do and how to do it.                                                                                        Entrepreneurial Skills-III  79","The entrepreneur is his own boss and must be motivated to set and pursue his goals. He or she is also responsible for               motivating others to work on the company's goals and reviewing how the company does it daily. Independence allows               an entrepreneur to work alone without reporting, but he is also responsible for ensuring that the customer is always in               focus. Providing high-quality products or services at the right price is one of the most important tasks for entrepreneurs.                Perseverance               Perseverance  means  not  giving  up  and  continuing  even  when  difficult  situations  arise.  There  are  many  challenges               involved  while  running  a  business.  A  responsible  entrepreneur  overcomes  these  challenges,  learns  from  them,  and               moves on, no matter what. Entrepreneurs need to stay optimistic and motivated when things get tough. While working               hard, an entrepreneur also needs to think about improvement and growth. Perseverance doesn't mean doing the same               process over and over again. It means finding different and creative ways to overcome difficulties and always thinking               about achieving the goal no matter what happens along the way.                 Open-mindedness               Open-mindedness means being open to trying new things and being open to take feedback from others. In the process               of starting and growing a business, an entrepreneur will try many different things. They will often need to consult others,               such as market experts and peers for information and ideas.               During this process, it is important to keep an open mind and to allow new thoughts and ideas come to you. This will               allow an entrepreneur to learn from failures and continue to improve the business.

He then tried to sell the mojaris by going door-to-door, but only a few people bought from him. He used to get                    tired and spend more money travelling.                    However, he remained optimistic and continued to go to more people to sell his product. He added new styles,                    sequins, and embroidery to the slippers and began making them in different sizes. He even involved his local                    friends who knew this skill in his business. Then one of his friends told him about becoming a seller on ‘Amazon’                    through which he could sell his mojaris without travelling to big cities. He immediately registered his company                    and started getting orders. Earlier, he could sell a maximum of 60 pairs of mojaris in a month, but now he sells                    more than 500 pairs every month. He even has a few overseas customers!                     1.

An entrepreneur should possess the following attitudes to be                  successful:                                                                    Belief in Self                                                    Focus on                                               Customer           Attitude       Decision Making                                                                    Responsibility                    Difference between the Attitude of Entrepreneurs and Employees are.

Entrepreneurial Skills-III  81","Problem-Solving                Problem-solving is a thought process through which an entrepreneur can come up with multiple solutions to improve               his business. The process begins by first recognising the problems. After understanding the problems, there are many               ways that an entrepreneur can solve them. An entrepreneur faces many problems or challenges. The problems may               be like finding the right idea, validating its market potential, buying equipment at the right cost, setting competitive               prices, etc. It's the ability to tackle them that makes an entrepreneur special. Let us discuss some of the ways most               entrepreneurs use to solve problems.                 Creativity               Creativity means to come up with ideas that others have not thought of before. Creativity does not mean being artistic               or being good at drawing. An entrepreneur has to believe that he can think of new ideas to solve a problem.                 Innovation               Innovation means coming up with new ideas and finding ways to implement them. The difference between creativity               and innovation is that creativity involves only thinking about new ideas, but innovation is also about finding ways to turn               those ideas into reality.                 Critical Thinking               Critical thinking means understanding the situation or problem by asking questions like why, what, when, how, and               investigating the situation or the reason for the problem. Entrepreneurs must always think critically when faced with a               challenge. Just worrying about the problems does not make them go away.                         Generating a Business Idea                A business idea is a solution that entrepreneurs think about to serve their customers. The idea determines what business               an entrepreneur pursues to make a profit. The idea can be a product, service, or hybrid model. There are a few important               points to consider while thinking of an idea.                     Business Idea                                Understanding                               the market                                           Planning the                                           business                                                                              Task                #Interdisciplinary                                                     Growing                                                     Business          1.  What is the purpose of a business idea?                                                                        2.  What do you understand by critical thinking?                          Principles of Idea Creation                Keep the following principles in mind while coming up with an idea:                Customer’s Need               An idea must satisfy the customer’s demand or need. A business idea can arise from an existing need in the market or               from a desire to improve what is already in the market. The product or service may not satisfy the customer’s needs.               Hence, there is a need to fill the gap.                      82      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","So, an entrepreneur thinks of starting a business to fulfill this need.                  For example, during the winter season, when the weather is very                  cold, people like to sit in the sunshine and drink hot tea/coffee/                  soup, so an entrepreneur can start a hot drink stall in a busy market.       Customer's                  Entrepreneurs often  work  with  the  idea  that  they  are  passionate         Need                  about. Not all entrepreneurs start with work as per market needs.                  Some entrepreneurs use their  own  interests and  talents  to  start                  a  business  and  serve  their  customers.  Knowing  your  interests                  and aptitudes is certainly important for entrepreneurs. It leads to             Idea                  self-confidence, and even others believe, and trust your abilities.           Creation                   Entrepreneur’s Own Interest or Talent                                                                                                           Entrepreneur’s                  Entrepreneurs typically pursue a passion  project. Entrepreneurs   Innovative             Own Interest                  do not always focus solely on market demand and needs. Some                                 or Talent                  businesses  begin by employing their  own  interests or  talents to                  assist customers. Identifying one's interests and talents is crucial for                  entrepreneurs, as it boosts self-confidence and builds trust in their abilities. For instance, a textile design student may                  capitalize on her passion to open a boutique selling various clothing items.                   Innovative                  Innovative refers to fresh approaches or original ideas. Businesses can be innovative in their ideas or processes. The odds                  of a business expanding increase if the idea is original, as is the way it is implemented. For example, a restaurant offers                  unique meal options for those who are ill, setting it apart from others.                           Building Business Ideas                   Most ideas come from either customer needs or inspiration from the behaviour of others. There are many ways to develop                  innovative and practical ideas for businesses. Following are the various types of ideas that entrepreneurs look into:                   Idea                                     Description                  Location based                           Entrepreneurs can develop ideas to meet the needs of customers in a                                                           particular location.                  Season based                             In  the  summer,  people  in  big  cities  want  to  drink  cold  and  healthy                                                           drinks, but in the winter, they like hot drinks. Depending on the season,                                                           entrepreneurs can develop ideas.                  Based on Events                          Considering methods to assist guests at events is another approach to                                                           generate business ideas. Various businesses, including wedding, parties,                                                           decor and food business, etc. offers a unique perspective for generating                                                           business ideas.                  Ideas based on self-interest             Entrepreneurs can find inspiration close to home in their own interests.                                                           Someone who loves and excels at dance, for example, could open a                                                           dance studio catering to both serious dancers and those seeking a fun                                                           fitness option                  Study based                              Your studies can be a gold mine for business ideas.

She found that the cafeteria in the                    company did not serve good quality tea. She also did not find any tea vendor near her company offices. After                    working in the company for three years, she decided to start a venture of her own. For this, she chose to sell                    good quality ‘chai’. She chose the area outside her previous company to start her ‘chai’ business. Every morning,                    she would serve hot tea to her customers with a smile. She also included several varieties of ‘chai’ like ‘Tulsi chai’,                    ‘Masala chai’, ‘Ginger chai’. Soon, her business started growing. People would willingly stop to buy a cup of ‘chai’                    from her and even chat with her.

Why did Asha come up with this idea?                      3.  Can you think of any idea to start a business?                            Understanding the Market                Entrepreneurs are directly responsible for ensuring that the needs of customers are met by the products or services               offered by them. Therefore, in this phase of the business, it is very important to understand exactly what most customers               want. Customer needs can be grouped into four types:                                                 Partially Fulfilled      Unfulfilled and                         Fulfilled Needs                                                           Unknown Needs                                                     Needs                 Known Needs                  Fulfilled Needs               These are the needs that customers understand. The needs are met by various companies or governments. For example,               the need for travelling modes is covered by both private bus services and state bus or metro services.                 Partially Fulfilled Needs               These are needs that are met through different products or services, but customers are not completely satisfied and               still have problems using them. For example, people always use taxi services like ola, uber and auto-rickshaws to get to               different places, but they struggle to find one on time and end up paying an extra amount for it.                 Unfulfilled and Known Needs               These needs are known to customers, but are not met by anyone in the market. For example, residents of small towns               had no electricity at all times, and therefore their children could not study after sunset. A company recognized this               problem and installed solar lamps, which are charged during the day and can be used at night.                Unknown Needs               These are needs that people have but are not aware of or expect to be addressed by a business. For example, 10 years               ago people didn't know that online education is possible. However, through innovation, entrepreneurs have found the               technology to make it happen.                      84      Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Certain aspects should be kept in mind while figuring out the above needs:                                            QUALITY              QUANTITY                                               Quality \& Quantity                         Price                                                             Location                                  Time                    Conducting a Customer Survey                  Surveying customers is an exercise entrepreneurs do to understand if there is a market for what they have to offer.                  Through this survey, entrepreneurs try to find out if they meet the needs of their customers and also understand what                  their preferences are. Surveying customers is one of the most effective ways to find out what customers want. Surveying                  can be done by talking directly to customers and asking them questions.                   Understanding Competitors                  Before an entrepreneur starts a business, another important step in understanding the market is knowing which other                  companies in the market offer the same product or service. This helps an entrepreneur understand the competition he/                  she may face. Some key aspects to keep in mind while studying your competition are:                                                                                  Position                                                                        (High quality/Low                                                   Any offer given to   quality brand, etc.)                                                       customer                                                        Relationship with                                                       Customer             Price                                                                                                  Entrepreneurial Skills-III  85","Conducting a Competitive Survey               Business  owners  need  to  survey  all  possible  businesses  to  find  out  what  is  available  in  the  market  and  what  their               competitors are doing.

The reasons for making a business plan are as follows:                  ●   Estimate of required funds: Once you know the products and sales destinations, the next step is to estimate the                     amount it will take to start a business. Without an estimate of the amount of money, an entrepreneur could make a                     large investment or start a business without enough money to run the business.                  ●   Estimating the amount of material required: Knowing the amount of material required lets the entrepreneur                     determine the cost of manufacturing a product or the cost of providing a service.                   ●   Standing out: A business plan, entrepreneurs need to think about how they can make their business different and                     special compared to other similar businesses.                   ●   Goal Setting: Another important reason for the plan is to set ambitious yet realistic goals. These goals motivate                     entrepreneurs to work hard.                   Improving Business Growth                  After starting a business, entrepreneurs need to think about how to continue to improve and grow by adding value to                  their business for attracting customers. The following principles need to be considered:                  ●   Quality: Business owners can improve their business by improving the quality of the products or services offered to                     their customers. This helps them get noticed in the business and also justifies higher prices.                       More Cash flow will help your business grow. For example, in the tea business, entrepreneurs can improve the quality                     of the product by offering various varieties of tea in different quantities.                  ●   Scale-up: Scaling-up means growing your  business  by attracting  more customers. There are a variety  of ways                     companies can reach out to more customers. One such path is to go to different geographical locations where you                     can find new customers. For example, sell tea in various markets, office locations where many people work, rather                     than in any highly competitive market.                  ●   Offer Alternatives: Another way to grow your business is to provide some offers to your customers. Alternatives                     mean products and services similar to the ones already in the market. For example, selling phone covers with mobile                     phones.

Ans.   Through surveying, entrepreneurs try to find out if they meet the needs of their customers and also understand                           what their preferences are. Surveying customers is one of the most effective ways to find out what customers want.                           Surveying can be done by talking directly to customers and asking them questions. Entrepreneurs are directly                           responsible for ensuring that the needs of customers are met by the products or services offered by them. In                           business, it is very important to understand exactly what most customers want.                        5.  Explain how perseverance and confidence make an entrepreneur successful?                      Ans.  Perseverance means not giving up and continuing even when difficult situations arise. There are many challenges                           involved while running a business. A responsible entrepreneur overcomes these challenges, learns from them,                           and moves on, no matter what. Entrepreneurs need to stay optimistic and motivated when things get tough.                           While working hard, an entrepreneur also needs to think about improvement and growth. Perseverance doesn't                           mean doing the same process over and over again. It means finding different and creative ways to overcome                           difficulties and always thinking about achieving the goal no matter what happens along the way.  Confidence                           means believing in yourself and your approach. Confidence helps business owners take the first step to start a                           new business, and then try new things to grow their business. It encourages entrepreneurs to continue even if                           they fail. Confidence also encourages business owners to visit customers and seek feedback on their products                           or services. Feedback helps entrepreneurs further improve and grow their businesses                    C.

The term Green Economy was initially coined in 1989.               You will delve into understanding the Green Economy, including its sectors and policies. Additionally, we will examine               the stakeholders involved, such as government and private agencies.

The term Green Economy refers to a low-carbon, resource-efficient, and socially inclusive economy. In Green Economy,               public and private investment in economic activities, infrastructure, and assets that allow for lower carbon emissions and               pollution, improved energy and resource efficiency, and the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services drive               employment and income growth.               A green economy does not replace sustainable development; rather, it places a fresh emphasis  on the economy,               investment, capital and infrastructure, jobs and skills, and beneficial social and environmental consequences throughout               Asia and the Pacific. Targeted public spending, policy reforms, and changes in taxation and regulation are all needed to               enable and promote these green initiatives. The Green Economy is a macroeconomic approach to long-term economic               growth that emphasises investments, job creation, and skill development.

GIM aims to conserve, restore and expand forest cover. It combines strategies for ecosystems, biodiversity,                  water, biomass, maintaining mangroves, wetlands, and key habitats, as well as services such as fuel, feed, timber, and                  non-wood forest products (fruits, flowers, seeds, herbs, honey, etc).                   National Solar Mission                  National Solar Mission aims to address India's energy needs in a sustainable manner. It aspires to make India a global                  leader in solar energy (a renewable form of energy, as opposed to coal, petroleum and other fossil fuels). Along with                  energy and environmental preservation, the Solar Mission supports local energy production and delivery. The Solar                  Mission has been a success in Diu, which became India's first Union Territory to switch to 100% solar energy.                   The transition to solar energy has also aided in the reduction of electricity bills for its citizens. Solar power plants have                  been erected over 50 acres in one of India's least populous UTs, with a geographical span of only 42 kilometres. On a                  daily basis, the UT generates a total of 13 megawatts of power through solar power generation plants. Rooftop solar                  plants produced roughly 3 megawatts (MW), while other solar power plants produced 10 megawatts (MW).

Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA)               On October 2, 2014, the Prime Minister of India launched the Swachh Bharat Mission to accelerate efforts to attain               universal sanitation coverage and to focus attention on sanitation. Under the project, all villages, Gram Panchayats,               Districts, States, and Union Territories in India pledged to be open defecation free (ODF) by October 2, 2019, the 150th               birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, by constructing over 100 million toilets in rural India.               To ensure that open defecation free behaviour is maintained and that solid and liquid waste management facilities are               available, the Mission is progressing to the next Phase II of SBMG, namely ODF-Plus. Under Phase II of the Swachh Bharat               Mission (Grameen), ODF Plus activities will reinforce ODF behaviour and focus on providing interventions for the safe               management of solid and liquid waste in villages.                 National Green Tribunal (NGT)               The National Green Tribunal, functions similar  to a court in disputes involving environmental preservation,  forest               conservation and other natural resource conservation. It adjudicates environmental disputes and may levy substantial               fines on those who cause environmental harm, take action to stop and rectify environmental damage, or even imprison               such individuals. For example, in March 2020, Jindal Power Limited (JPL) and Coal India's, South Eastern Coalfields (SECL)               were found guilty of causing environmental harm in Raigarh by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and sentenced to pay               160 crore as damages.

A                  green  economy  has  many  stakeholders  since,  it  impacts  everyone  and  requires  the  assistance  of  many  individuals.                  Because the environment impacts you and your activities have an impact on the environment, you are an important                  stakeholder as well.                   All sectors of society and all sorts of individuals must actively participate for sustainable development to occur. People                  interested in a green economy can be classified into the major stakeholder categories. Let us learn about some of them.                    Government                  Governments and municipal bodies create and implement laws, policies, strategies, standards, programs, agreements                  with other countries, and activities to promote sustainable development.                    Non-Governmental Organisations                  Many individual social workers and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) assist the government and community in                  adopting Green Economic measures.                   Companies                  The success  of the green economy is  dependent  on active participation from both the public and private sectors.                  Companies must adhere to good business operations while also protecting the environment.                   Workers                  Workers play a critical role in our economy. Green policies seek to provide them with:                  •  a decent living and a decent job in a healthy environment.                  •  access to health care, clean water and sanitation.                  •  access to education and skill development.                    Farmers                  Farmers grow food and generate agricultural items for the entire country. They are one of the most vital components of                  any economy and society. They play an important part in the success of a Green Economy.

Many               such tribes in India's hills and forests can benefit from the green economy. For example, tribals in Nangur village in Bastar               district, Chattisgarh have greatly benefited from using various parts of the Mahua plant to make eco-friendly plates,               cones, and bowls. The tribals have turned this into a lucrative local business.                Tribes should revitalise their local economy, i.e. promote local products. By developing and using our local products,               tribal dependence on outside produce reduces. This will make them self-reliant, thus achieving economic independence.                 Science and Technology               Science and Technology is required in all sectors of sustainable development. Scientists can explain technical issues to               governments and policymakers. They can also offer long-term answers to improve people's lives.

Have you ever wondered how Google gives auto-suggestions                  when you type something in the search bar? Welcome to the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI). You do realise that                  you are already using AI in your everyday lives! AI is all around us. When we tell Alexa to play a song or Siri to set                  a reminder, we are working with AI. So, can we say that our machines are intelligent? Intelligence is the term that                  includes the following mental abilities:                  •  Analysis                                       •  Planning                  •  Solving problems                               •  Building conclusions                  •  Abstract thinking                              •  Learning languages                  •  Speed of learning                              •  Ability to feel and express feelings                  •  Understanding the feelings of others                           Introduction to Artificial Intelligence                   Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that simulates human intelligence in machines, particularly                  in computer systems, enabling them to think and perform actions similar to humans.                  Artificial Intelligence is made up of the words Artificial and Intelligence, where Artificial defines \"human-made\", and                  Intelligence defines “thinking ability”, hence AI means “a human-made thinking ability”.                  The term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ was coined by John McCarthy. In 1956, John organised the Dartmouth Conference                  where, in his talk, he first used the term “artificial intelligence”, defined as the science and engineering of making                  intelligent machines. John McCarthy is also known as the ‘Father of AI’.

Answer the following questions:                    1.  What role does Jarvis play in Tony Stark’s life?                       2.  How does Jarvis help Tony Stark/Iron Man?                      3.  Finally, who is Jarvis? Is Jarvis real or virtual?                              Why Artificial Intelligence?                 In simple terms, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that combines computer science and large sets of data to               solve problems. AI doesn’t replace human decisions; it enhances human judgement. Think of AI as a smart assistant               that can understand, learn from experiences, and perform tasks independently without needing detailed instructions               each time. AI can:                   • Understand Language: AI can understand and respond to what you say, like virtual assistants such as Siri or Alexa.                  • Recognise Images: AI can look at pictures and identify what's in them, such as recognising animals in photos.                  • Make Predictions: AI can analyse data to make predictions, like forecasting the weather or suggesting movies you                  might like.                   • Play Games: AI can play games and improve them, like playing chess or video games.                  • Drive Cars: AI can help cars drive by sensing the road and making safe driving decisions.

Brainy Fact                          The first-ever AI game was built by John McCarthy at MIT on the IBM 704. The program would take days                         to process a single move and didn’t stop for months. Students and McCarthy himself, from time to time,                         made modifications to improve its efficiency and accuracy. Interestingly, in 1966 when McCarthy was                         at Stanford, he designed another chess game with his team to compete with their counterparts in the                         Soviet Union. Unfortunately, they never won with two losses and two draws.                              What is NOT AI?                   Today, we are surrounded by a wide variety of devices. As a result, we frequently misidentify any other technology as                  AI. That is why, it is crucial to clarify the distinction between what constitutes AI and what does not.                  As we all know, artificial intelligence refers to any system that has been trained with data and can make decisions/                  predictions on its own. Here are some examples of what is not artificial intelligence:                                           •  Traditional rule-based systems do not learn from data and instead, follow pre-defined rules.                      •  Simple automation tools, such as timers and calculators, do certain tasks without thinking or learning.                     •  Mechanical devices, such as pulleys or gears, rely on physics and cannot think or learn.                     •  Microwave ovens are examples of fixed-function hardware that performs tasks without thinking or learning.                     •  Non-interactive systems are machines that do not respond to new input, such as a basic electric fan.                     • Basic sensors collect data but do not evaluate it.

It excels at performing a single task or                  a narrow set of tasks, often with high efficiency and accuracy, but lacks general                  reasoning and problem-solving capabilities outside its designated area.                  Consider Siri, the virtual assistant on an iPhone, it uses speech and language                  recognition techniques to set an alarm, or send an SMS to a contact on your phone.

The                                           machine can mimic human behaviour with the ability to learn and solve problems.                                           AGI can think, learn and decide in a similar manner as humans would do in a situation.                                           Till now Strong AI is a theory, researchers and scientists have not achieved it. For AGI,                                           machines will have to go through experiential learning where not only the human                                           intelligence is to be replicated, emotions, beliefs and other thought processes need                                           to be simulated. In simple words, machines need to be trained to think like humans.                     AGI—Ex Machina                    Artificial Super Intelligence               Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical form of artificial intelligence that surpasses               human  intelligence  across  all  domains,  including  creativity,  problem-solving,  and  social               intelligence.               A machine with ASI has intelligence more than human beings. It can do tasks beyond human               capabilities.  ASI  is  a  hypothetical  idea  of  an  AI  where  machines  become  self-aware  and               surpass human intelligence and abilities. A super AI will be capable of thinking, analyse,               perform, plan, decide, learn, and communicate on its own.

Introduction: Artificial Intelligence for Everyone   119","Types of Data               Data comes in different forms that affect how we analyse and understand information. Knowing about these type of               data: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Help us manage data better and find useful insights from a wide               range of datasets.

It includes information such as names, dates, addresses, and stock prices. Because of its organised nature,                  it is straightforward to analyse and manipulate, making it a preferred format for many data-related tasks.                  • Semi-structured Data: This falls somewhere between structured and unstructured data. While not as organised as                  structured data, it is easier to handle than unstructured data. Semi-structured data uses metadata to identify certain                  characteristics and organise data into fields, allowing some level of organisation and analysis. An example of semi-                  structured data is an email. Emails contain structured elements such as the sender, recipient, timestamp, and subject                  line, which follow a predictable format. However, the body of the email itself is unstructured, as it can contain free-                  form text, images, and attachments.                  • Unstructured Data: Unstructured data refers to information that lacks a predefined data model or is not organised                  in  a  systematic  manner.  This  absence  of  specific  organisation  makes  it  more  challenging  to  analyse  compared                  to  structured  data.  Examples  include  images,  text  documents,  customer  comments,  and  song  lyrics.  Extracting                  meaningful insights from unstructured data requires specialised tools and techniques due to its varied formats and                  lack of predefined structure.

Here are some examples of how NLP enriches your life, without you noticing it:                     • Autocomplete recommends the next word.                     • In the Google search field, predictive typing suggests the next/remaining words in the sentence.                     • Spell checks eliminate misspellings, errors, and spellings that are stylistically inappropriate.                     • Grammar  checkers  ensure  that  you  use proper  punctuation  and  warn  you  if you  use the  incorrect  article or                    proposition. For example, Grammarly.                     • Converts spoken language into written text.                     • Companies use NLP to perform sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion on social media.                  NLP consists of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG).                                                                                  Syntactic parsing                                                                                  Semantic analysis                                                        Natural Language                                             Natural Language Processing     Named entity recognition                                                         Understanding                                                                                   Sentiment analysis                                                                                    Text planning                                                          Natural Language     Date-to-text transformation                                                           Generation                                                                                 Surface realisation                   Let us understand what these terms mean:                    • Natural Language Understanding (NLU): NLU is a subfield of NLP that focuses on comprehending the meaning                    of human language. It involves analysing text and speech to extract information, intent, and sentiment. NLU helps                    computers understand what the language actually means. Imagine finding a specific book in the library that provides                    deep insights into a topic. For instance, NLU is used in spam filters to determine whether an email is legitimate or spam.                     • Natural Language Generation (NLG): NLG is another subfield of NLP, but instead of understanding, it focuses on                    generating human language. It takes structured data as input and converts it into coherent and readable text or                    speech. Think of NLG as writing a new book based on the information collected from the library. A real-life example                    of NLG is automatic report generation, where software creates financial reports based on data from spreadsheets.                          Computer Vision                    Computer Vision is like giving computers the ability to see and understand the world through digital images and                  videos, similar to how humans use their eyes to perceive their surroundings. In this domain, computers analyse visual                  information from images and videos to recognise objects, understand scenes, and make decisions based on what                  they \"see\".                                                                    Introduction: Artificial Intelligence for Everyone   121","When we take a digital image, it is essentially a grid of tiny coloured dots called pixels. A pixel is the smallest unit of a               digital image or graphic that can be displayed and manipulated on a digital display device. Each pixel represents a small               part of the image and contains information about its colour and intensity. The resolution of an image is expressed as               the total number of pixels along its width and height. For example, an image with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels have               1920 pixels horizontally and 1080 pixels vertically. Higher-resolution images have more pixels, providing more detail.               AI helps make sense of these images by converting them into numbers. Computers break down the image into a series               of numbers representing the colour and intensity of each pixel. This numerical representation allows AI algorithms               to process the image mathematically and extract meaningful information from it. For instance, AI algorithms might               learn to recognise patterns in these numbers that correspond to specific objects, like cars or faces. By analysing large               amounts of labelled image data, AI systems can “learn” to identify objects accurately.                                                                           0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0                                                      0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0                                                      0  0  0141  36 54  0  0  0  1  0  0  1 89 156 66  45  0  1  0  0  0  0141  36 54  0  0  0  1  0  0  1 89 156 66  45  0  1  0                                                      0  0  0182 245255  47 15  0  8  0  0  0200 250255  90  0  0  0  0  0  0182 245255  47 15  0  8  0  0  0200 250255  90  0  0  0                                                      0  0  0 89 251255  251 58  0  0  4  9  0 25 255251 150  2  0  1  0  0  0 89 251255  251 58  0  0  4  9  0 25 255251  150  2  0  1                                                      0  0  0190 248200 253240  15  0  0  3  0 95  253145 115  0  0  0  0  0  0190 248200 253240  15  0  0  3  0 95  253145  115  0  0  0                                                      0  0  0100  254250  248250 255 45  1  0  0101 251255  79  0  0  0  0  0  0100 254250  248250 255 45  1  0  0101 251255  79  0  0  0                                                      0  9  9150 204251  215187  255 36  0  0  0 99 253251  36  2  0  0  0  9  9150 204251  215187 255 36  0  0  0 99 253251  36  2  0  0                                                      0  0  0110 253251 189215 255248 100  0  0 68 251255 126  5  5  5  0  0  0110 253251 189215 255248 100  0  0 68 251255 126  5  0  0                                                      0  5  5200 240253  38 57 236254  33  0  1136  253254 101  0  0  0  0  5  5200 240253  38 57 236254  33  0  1136  253254  101  0  0  0                                                      0  0  0 99  200255  40  4  55201  236 56  0101 246251  78  0  0  0  0  0  0 99 200255  40  4  55201  236 56  0101 246251  78  0  0  0                                                      0  0  0150  251254 150  1  60220  241201  78 25 185255  90  0  0  0  0  0  0150 251254 150  1  60220  241201  78 25 185255  90  0  0  0                                                      0  2  2 87 248252  56  0  0140 251235 178 88 255251 160  0  0  0  0  2  2 87 248252  56  0  0140 251235 178 88 255251 160  0  0  0                                                      0  0  0 78 250200 136  0  0 44  48230  250 27  235251  76  0  0  0  0  0  0 78 250200  136  0  0 44  48230 250 27  235251  76  0  0  0                                                      0  0  0 90 255253  60  3  0  0  40246 160231 225254  55  0  0  0  0  0  0 90 255253  60  3  0  0  40246 160231 225254  55  0  0  0                                                      0  1  1 79  201251  51  0  1  0  0110  255235  105236  84  6  6  0  0  1  1 79  201251  51  0  1  0  0110 255235  105236  84  6  0  0                                                      0  0  0101 250255 120  1  0  0  0 10 251250 254255  78  0  0  0  0  0  0101 250255 120  1  0  0  0 10 251250 254255  78  0  0  0                                                      0  0  0 99 255214  66  0  0  0  0  0  34200 150251  185  0  0  0  0  0  0 99 255214  66  0  0  0  0  0  34200  150251 185  0  0  0                                                      0  0  0205 251251  55  1  0  6  0  0  15255 253245  86  0  0  0  0  0  0205 251251  55  1  0  6  0  0  15255  253245  86  0  0  0                                                      0  0  0 81  78 56  40  0  0  4  0  0  0195  35155  55  0  0  0  0  0  0 81  78 56  40  0  0  4  0  0  0195  35155  55  0  0  0                                                      0  0  0  0  9  0  0  0  7  0  0  0  0  6  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  9  0  0  0  7  0  0  0  0  6  0  0  0  0  0  0                                                      0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  6  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  6  0  0  0  0  0  0               For example, self-driving cars use computer vision to navigate roads safely.

Introduction: Artificial Intelligence for Everyone   123","Cognitive Computing (Perception, Learning, and Reasoning)                Cognitive  computing  refers  to  individual  technologies  that  perform  specific  tasks  to  enable  human  intelligence.               Basically, they are smart decision support systems that we have been working with since the internet boom began.               With recent technological advances, these support systems are simply using better data and better algorithms to get               a better analysis of a large amount of information. So, cognitive computing:               •  understands and simulates reasoning.               •  understands and simulates human behaviour.               The use of cognitive computing systems helps make better human decisions at work. Some of the uses of cognitive               computing includes speech recognition, sentiment analysis, facial recognition, risk assessment, and fraud detection.                How Does it Work?               Cognitive computing is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that aims to simulate human thought processes in a computerised               model.               Cognitive computing systems synthesise data from various information sources while considering context and conflicting               evidence to provide appropriate responses. To do this, cognitive systems include self-learning technologies that use data               mining, pattern recognition, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand how the human brain works.               Using computer systems to solve problems that should be handled by humans requires large amounts of structured               and unstructured data. Over a period of time, cognitive systems have learned to refine the way they recognise patterns               and process data so that they can anticipate new problems and model possible solutions.               Imagine a scenario in which a person decides to make a career change. An artificial intelligence assistant automatically               assesses the job applicant's skills, finds a relevant position where his skills match the position, and negotiates a               salary, and benefits. In the final stage, the person is informed that a decision has been made on his behalf.                       Cognitive Computing                                                                                 •   Assess Skills                                                                                 •   Find Relevant Job                                                                                 •   Negotiate Pay                                             •   Suggest Career Path                                •   Salary Comparison                                •   Job Openings                                                                                         Artificial Intelligence                   A cognitive assistant, on the other hand, suggests possible career paths to the job applicant and informs the person               of important details such as additional educational requirements, salary comparison data, and vacancies.               However, the final decision in this case still has to be made by the job applicant.                So, cognitive computing helps us make smarter decisions on our own. While AI is based on the idea that machines               can make better decisions for us.                       124     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Cognitive Computing platform is                       The platform computes outcomes using                       built on artificial intelligence and              Machine Learning, Reasoning, Natural Language                              signal processing.

Introduction: Artificial Intelligence for Everyone   127","Supervised Learning               Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from labelled data, meaning the input data               is accompanied by the correct output. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns to map input data to output labels               based  on  sample  input-output  pairs  provided  during  the  training  phase.  The  goal  is  to  learn  a  mapping  function               from input variables to output variables so the model can make predictions on unseen data. Examples of supervised               learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and               neural networks.

For instance, in email filtering, supervised learning               algorithms can classify emails as spam or non-spam based on labelled data. In finance, supervised learning models               predict  stock  prices  or  assess  credit  risk.  In  healthcare,  these  algorithms  help  to  diagnose  diseases  by  analysing               patient data with known outcomes, improving both accuracy and efficiency in medical predictions.

In unsupervised learning, the algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or structures in the input data without               explicit guidance. The goal is to explore and discover inherent structures or relationships within the data, such as               clusters,  associations,  or  anomalies.  Examples  of  unsupervised  learning  algorithms  include  k-means  clustering,               hierarchical clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and autoencoders.               This approach is useful in various real-life applications. For example, in market segmentation, unsupervised learning               can identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behaviour, helping businesses tailor marketing strategies.               In genomics, these algorithms can uncover patterns in DNA sequences, aiding in understanding genetic influences               on diseases. In cybersecurity, anomaly detection algorithms can identify unusual patterns of activity, helping to detect               potential security breaches or fraudulent behaviour.

The  agent  learns  through  trial  and  error,  taking  actions,  and  receiving                  feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The objective is to develop a policy or strategy that enables the agent to                  take actions that results in the highest cumulative reward over a period of time. Reinforcement learning is often applied                  in situations requiring a series of decisions, such as playing games, controlling robots, or managing financial portfolios.                  Examples of reinforcement learning algorithms include Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), policy gradients, and                  actor-critic methods.                  This technique is also employed in real-world scenarios, like autonomous driving, where vehicles learn to navigate by                  interacting with their surroundings.

Examples of reinforcement learning algorithms include Q-learning, Deep                           Q-Networks (DQN), policy gradients, and actor-critic methods.                        9.  What is semi-structured data? Give an example of semi-structured data.                      Ans.  Semi-structured  data  falls  somewhere  between  structured  and  unstructured  data.  While  not  as  organised  as                           structured data, it is easier to handle than unstructured data. Semi-structured data uses metadata to identify certain                           characteristics and organise data into fields, allowing for some level of organisation and analysis. An example of                           semi-structured data is an email.                       10.   Name the 3 types of AI. Which one are we currently using?

Modes in Python                    In Python, particularly when using Python IDLE, there are two main modes in which you can work. These modes are                  Interactive mode and Script mode.                    Interactive Mode                  Interactive mode allows you to enter Python commands directly into the command line shell and immediately see the                  results. In Interactive mode, we type one command at a time. Interactive mode is useful for quick experimentation,                  testing snippets of code, or exploring the behaviour of Python functions and modules. The Interactive mode does not                  save the commands entered by the user in the form of a program.                   Follow these steps to start Python IDLE and work in Interactive mode:                  Step 1:   Click on the Start button.                  Step 2:   Scroll down the list of programs and click on the Python 3.12 folder.                   Step 3:   Click on the IDLE (Python 3.12 64-bit) app.                   The main IDLE window appears. It is a code editor which helps you to write and                  execute Python programs in the editor itself.                   There are two components of Python IDLE window:                   • •  • Menu Bar: The Menu Bar of Python IDLE window is similar to the Menu Bar of                      other programs. It has various menus such as File, Edit, Shell, Debug, Options, Window and Help.                  • •  • Prompt: You will see a symbol (>>>) in the window. This is known as the Prompt. The Prompt allows the user to                      enter commands directly into Python and get an output instantly by pressing the Enter key.                                                                    Menu bar                                               Prompt                     Type the commands at the prompt and you will immediately get the results. Simply, type 3 + 3 and press the Enter key.                  The result 6 appears on the screen. Try more values with different operations and see result.                                                                                                                  Python Programming     167","Script Mode               Script mode refers to writing and running Python programs as standalone scripts, rather than executing code interactively.               Script mode involves writing Python code in a text file with a .py extension and then executing that file using the Python               interpreter. You create Python scripts using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and then run               them from the command line or terminal. Script mode is suitable for developing larger programs, modules, or scripts               that perform specific tasks or functions.                Create a New File               Follow these steps to create a new file:                Step 1:   Open the Python IDLE window.               Step 2:   Click on the File menu. A drop-down menu appears.               Step 3:   Click on the New File option.               A new editor window with a blank file will appear on the screen.                 Create and Save a Program               The steps to write and save a program are as follows:               Step 1:   Type the program code in Python window.                           Step 2:   Click on the File menu.               Step 3:   Click on the Save option. The Save As dialog box appears.                Step 4:   Navigate the location where you want to save the file.                Step 5:   Enter the name of the file in the File name text box.               Step 6:   Click on the Save button.                                          The file will be saved by the given name at the specified location.                       168     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Run a Program                  Follow these steps to run a Python program:                  Step 1:   Click on the Run menu in the Menu bar. Alternately, press F5 to run the program.                  Step 2:   Select on the Run Module option.                              The program will execute and the output will be shown in the Shell window.                                          Input and Output                   Python provides two commonly used functions input() and print() for input and output.                   • •    The input() Function: The input() function takes the user’s input while a program executes. When called, it waits                      for the user to type something on the keyboard and press the Enter key. The function then returns the user input as                      a string. The syntax of the input() function is as follows:                       input([<prompt>])                      Where, prompt is the string or message we wish to display on the screen.                      Example:                       name = input(\"Enter your name: \")                   • •    The print() Function: The print() function prints or sends the output to the standard output device, which                      is usually a monitor. This function auto converts the items to strings, i.e., if you try printing a numeric value, the                      print() function will automatically convert it into an equivalent string and print it. The print() function also                      introduces spaces between items automatically with the help of the comma operator.                  •   The syntax of the print() function is as follows:                      print (<expression 1> , <expression 2>...)                      Example:                      print (\"Python is easy\")                    Program 1: To demonstrate the use of the input( ) and print( ) functions                       name =input(\"Enter your name: \")                      age =input(\"Enter your age: \")                      print(name,\"your age is\", age)                       Output:                       Enter your name: Yash                      Enter your age: 25                      Yash your age is 25                                                                                          Python Programming     169","The  format()  method  in  Python  is  used  to  print  the  values  in  the  specified  format  and  insert  them  into  a  string's               placeholders, which are defined using curly brackets {}. The detailed explanation along with examples demonstrating               how to use the format() method with integers, strings, and decimals. For float, two decimal places with .2f is used. The               syntax of the format () is as follows:                     string.format(value1, value2, ...)                 Program 2: To demonstrate the use of format()                     name = input(\"Enter Name: \")                    age = int(input(\"Enter Age: \"))                    percentage=float(input(\"Enter Your Percentage in Previous Class: \"))                     print(\"My name is {}.\".format(name))                    print(\"I am {} years old.\".format(age))                    print(\"My percentage is {:.2f}\".format(percentage))                     Output:                     Enter Name: Yash                    Enter Age: 26                    Enter Your Percentage in Previous Class: 86.5                    My name is Yash.                    I am 26 years old.                    My percentage is 86.50                          Comments in Python                In Python, comments are used to annotate code with explanations, documentation, or notes. Comments are ignored               by the Python interpreter during execution and are solely for human readers. Python supports two types of comments:                • •    Single line comments: Single line comments start with the hash character # and continue until the end of the line.                   Anything following the # on that line is considered a comment and is ignored by the interpreter.                  Program 3: To demonstrate the use of single line comment                     # This is a single line comment                    print(\"Hello, world!\")  # This is another single line comment                     Output:                     Hello, world!                • •    Multiline comments: Python does not have a built-in syntax for multiline comments like some other languages.                   However, multiline strings enclosed within triple quotes (‘‘‘ or “””) are often used for this purpose. Although these are                   technically strings and not comments, they serve the purpose of commenting out multiple lines of code.                  Program 4: To demonstrate the use of multiline comments                     '''                    This program demonstrates basic arithmetic operations without using functions.

Each character in a character set is represented                  by a unique code point.                  A programming language’s character set refers to the permissible  characters recognised by that language.  When                  discussing the Python programming language specifically, its character set encompasses all valid characters allowed for                  scripting. These include:                   • •  Letters: Both uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) letters.                   • •  Digits: All numerical digits from 0 to 9.                   • •    Special Symbols: Python accommodates various special symbols such as single quotes ('...'), double (\"...“), semicolons                      (;), colons (:), exclamation marks(!), tildes (~), at symbols(@), hash signs (#), dollar signs ($), percentage signs (%),                      caret sign (^), backticks (`), ampersands (\&), asterisks (*), parentheses (), underscores(_), plus signs(+), hyphens(-),                      equal signs(=), curly braces {}, square brackets [], and backslashes(\\).                   • •    Whitespace  characters: Python recognises  whitespace characters  including tab spaces, blank spaces, newline                      characters, and carriage return characters.                   • •    Others: Python supports the entirety of ASCII and Unicode characters, comprising the complete Python character                      set.                            Tokens                    A token is the smallest unit of a program that has a meaning. Tokens in Python are fundamental elements of the language’s                  syntax. They represent the building blocks of Python code, consisting of keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and                  punctuations. Understanding tokens is essential for comprehending Python’s lexical structure (basic syntax and set of                  rules defining how Python programs are written) and parsing rules (guidelines used by a parser to analyse the structure                  of code).                  Python code is first divided into tokens during the lexical analysis phase of the interpretation process. These tokens are                  then used by the parser to construct the abstract syntax tree (AST a tree representation of Python code that is used for                  code analysis and manipulation), which is further processed to execute the code.

They cannot be               used as identifiers or variable names. These keywords are part of Python’s syntax and are used to define control flow,               declare functions and classes, handle exceptions, etc.               Following table shows the keywords used in Python:                                    and          as           assert       async        await                                    break        class        continue     def          del                                    elif         else         except       False        finally                                    for          from         global       if           import                                    in           is           lambda       None         nonlocal                                    not          or           pass         raise        return                                    True         try          while        with         yield                 Identifiers               Identifiers are the names used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, and other objects in Python. They act as               labels for these elements, allowing you to refer to them in your code. Identifiers follow certain rules and conventions:                • •  Must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).                • •  Subsequent characters can be letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.                • •  Case-sensitive (myVar is different from myvar).                 • •  Cannot be a Python keyword (reserved words).                • •  No special characters such as !, @, #, $, %, etc., are allowed within identifiers.                • •  Blank spaces within an identifier are disallowed.               For example:                     my_variable                    calculate_sum                    MyClass               Some conventions that can be used while specifying identifiers for more clarity are as follows:                 • •  Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable, function, etc.                • •    Follow the snake_case convention for variable names and function names. This means using all lowercase letters                   with words separated by underscores. For example: my_variable, calculate_sum.                 • •    Follow the PascalCase convention for class names. This means capitalising the first letter of each word, without                   underscores. For example: MyClass, BankAccount.                • •  Use all uppercase letters with underscores to denote constants. For example: MAX_SIZE, PI.                 Literals               Literals in Python represent fixed values that are used directly in the code. They can be of several types:                 • •  Numeric literals: Represented as integers, floating-point numbers, or complex numbers. Examples: 42, 3.14, 1 + 2j.                • •    String  literals: Represented as sequences of characters enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes. Examples:                   'hello', \"world\", '''multiline string'''.                 • •  Boolean literals: Represented as True or False.                • •  None literal: Represented as None that indicates the absence of a value.                Operators               In Python, operators can be defined as special symbols which perform arithmetic and logical computation. The values               which the operators use to get the output are called operands.                      172     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Arithmetic Operators                  Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,                  modulus, exponentiation, and floor division.

To define the beginning of an indented code block.                • •  Semicolon (;): Can be used to separate statements on the same line.                 • •    Question Mark (?): In some contexts, such as libraries like NumPy or IPython, it’s used for querying documentation                   or help.                 • •  Exclamation Mark (!): Often used in Python shells like IPython or Jupyter notebooks to execute shell commands.                • •  Parentheses (()) and Brackets ([]): Used for grouping expressions, function calls, and indexing/slicing sequences.                • •  Quotation Marks (' and \"): Used to denote string literals.                • •  Curly Braces ({}): Used to denote sets and dictionaries, and in formatting strings.                 • •  Asterisk (*): Used for multiplication, exponentiation, and in unpacking iterables.                • •  Forward Slash (/): Used for division.                • •  Backslash (\\): Used for line continuation or as an escape character in strings.                       180     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","• •  Percentage Sign (%): Used in string formatting (old-style formatting).                   • •  Underscore (_): Used as a variable name, or in naming conventions, such as snake_case.                   • •  Hash (#): Used to create comments in Python code.                   • •  At Sign (@): Used in decorators.                   • •  Dollar Sign ($): Used in some Python libraries like pandas for referencing columns in data frames.                    • •  Tilde (~): Used as the complement operator in bitwise operations.                   • •    Double Underscore (__): Used in special methods (dunder/magic methods) and sometimes for name mangling in                      classes.                   • •  Angle Brackets (< and >): Used for comparison operations.                   • •  Vertical Bar or Pipe (|): Used in bitwise OR operations.                   • •  Ampersand (\&): Used in bitwise AND operations.                   • •  Caret (^): Used in bitwise XOR operations.                    • •  Double Period (..): Used in some libraries and frameworks for specifying ranges or intervals.                   • •  Ellipsis (...): Used as a placeholder in some contexts, such as in NumPy arrays or as part of type hints.                   • •  Minus-Equivalent (-=): Used in augmented assignment statements.                   • •  Double Greater Than (>>) and Double Less Than (<<): Used in bit shifting operations.                           Variables                    In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data values. Variables in Python do not have fixed locations in                  memory. The memory location they refer to changes every time their values change.                   Variable Assignment                  Variables in Python are declared simply by assigning a value to them using the assignment operator (=).                  Python syntax for assigning a value to a variable can be described as follows:                       <Variable_name> = <value>                  For example:                      x = 10                      name = \"Yash\"                      my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]                  Unlike some  other programming languages, Python does not require explicit declaration  of variables before they                  are used. When a variable is assigned a value, Python automatically determines its data type based on the assigned                  value. Python variables can hold values of various data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples,                  dictionaries, and more.                  For example:                       # Integer variable                      age = 30                       # Float variable                      pi = 3.14                       # String variable                      message = \"Hello, World!\"                       # Boolean variable                      is_student = True                                                                                          Python Programming     181","# List variable                    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]                     # Tuple variable                    point = (10, 20)                     # Dictionary variable                    person = {'name': 'Yash', 'age': 30}                Multiple Assignment               Multiple assignment of variables, also known as parallel assignment, is a powerful feature in many programming               languages that allows you to assign multiple variables at once. This concept can significantly enhance code readability,               efficiency, and flexibility.               For example:                     x, y, z = 1, 2, 3               In given code, the values 1, 2, and 3 are assigned to variables x, y, and z, respectively. This simultaneous assignment               saves lines of code and improves readability compared to assigning each variable separately.               Multiple assignment is not limited to simple variables. It works with any iterable data structure, including tuples, lists,               and even custom objects that support iteration and unpacking.               For example:                     point = (5, 10)                    x, y = point               In the given code, the values (5, 10) are unpacked from the point tuple and assigned to variables x and y respectively.               This syntax is concise and expressive, making code more elegant and maintainable.                For example:                     [a, b, c] = [1, 2, 3]               In this example, a, b, and c are assigned the values 1, 2, and 3 respectively from the list [1, 2, 3].                          Data Types in Python                 Data types in Python specify the type of values that a variable can hold. Python is dynamically typed, which means there               is no need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. Python automatically assigns the appropriate data type to a               variable based on the value assigned to it.                This flexibility makes Python a versatile language for various programming tasks. Python allows different operations to               be performed on different data types.                The following tree structure shows the various data types used in Python:                                                                  Data Types                                  Numeric       Dictionary           Sequence         Set         Boolean        None                                  Floating                   Integer               Complex           List    Tuple    String                               Point                      182     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Numeric Data Type                  Numeric data types are used to store numeric values. In Python, there are three main numeric data types: integer,                  floating point, and complex.                   • •    Integer (int): Integers are whole numbers, positive or negative, without any decimal point. They can be of unlimited                      size, subject only to the memory available.                  •   For example:                         x = 10                          y = -20                   • •    Floating Point (float): Floating-point numbers (floats) represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point                      dividing the integer and fractional parts.                  •   For example:                          pi = 3.14                         temperature = 98.6                   • •    Complex (complex): Complex numbers are written with a “j” as the imaginary part. A complex number is of the                      form x + yj and comprises a pair of floating point numbers. The first part (x) is called the real part, and the second                      one (y) is called the imaginary part.                  •   For example:                         z = 5 + 3j                    Dictionary Data Type                  Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}. Each key in a dictionary must be                  unique and immutable, and it is used to access its corresponding value. Dictionaries are commonly used because they                  provide fast access to values based on their keys.                  For example:                       person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}                  Sequence Data Type                  In Python, a sequence data type refers  to an ordered collection of elements,  where each element is  indexed by a                  non-negative integer. There are mainly three sequence data types in Python, including lists, tuples, and strings.                   • •    Lists: Lists are mutable sequences, meaning their elements can be changed after creation. They are defined using                      square brackets [ ] and can contain elements of different data types.                      For example:                           my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']                   • •    Tuples: Tuples are immutable sequences, meaning their  elements cannot  be changed  after  creation.  They  are                      defined using parentheses ( ) and can contain elements of different data types.                      For example:                           my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c')                   • •    Strings: Strings are immutable sequences of characters. They are defined using either single quotes (' ') or double                      quotes (\" \").                      For example:                           my_string = 'Hello, World!'                          my_string1 = \"Hello, World!\"                  •   •  In Python, you can create multiline strings using triple quotes. Triple quotes can be either single quotes (''') or                      double quotes (\"\"\"). Multiline strings are often used for docstrings (documentation strings), multiline comments, or                      for storing large blocks of text.                                                                                           Python Programming     183","For example:                       multiline_string = \"\"\"                       This is a multiline string.                       It can span across multiple lines.                       Triple quotes allow you to include line breaks without using escape characters.                       \"\"\"                Set Data Type               In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove               elements from them after they are created. You can create a set in Python by enclosing a comma-separated list of               elements within curly braces {}. The key characteristic of sets in Python is that they do not allow duplicate elements.               For example:                    # Creating a set using curly braces                    my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}                Boolean Data Type               The Boolean data type in Python represents one of two values: True or False. Booleans are commonly used for logical               operations, conditional expressions, and control flow in programming. In Python, the integer value 0 is considered false,               while any non-zero integer value is considered true. This means that when evaluated in a boolean context, 0 evaluates               to False, and any other non-zero integer value evaluates to True.               For example:                     is_valid = True                    is_empty = False               None Data Type               None is a special constant in Python that represents the absence of a value or represents a null value. It is often used to               indicate that a variable has not been assigned a value.               For example:                     x = None               Type Casting               Type casting, also known as type conversion, in Python refers to the process of converting a variable from one data               type to another. Python has two types of type casting: implicit and explicit. In the case of implicit type casting, Python               automatically converts one data type to another data type. On the other hand, we need to convert one data type to               another data type explicitly by using the Python functions. Python provides several built-in functions for type casting.               Some of them are as follows:                • •  int(): Converts a value to an integer.                • •  float(): Converts a value to a float.                • •  str(): Converts a value to a string.                • •  bool(): Converts a value to a boolean.                • •  list(): Converts a value to a list.                • •  tuple(): Converts a value to a tuple.                • •  set(): Converts a value to a set.                • •  dict(): Converts a sequence of key-value pairs to a dictionary.

Operations on List                   We can perform different types of operations on a list, like accessing elements, adding elements, and removing elements.                  Before performing any operation, we need to first create a list.                   Creating a List                  You can create a list by placing all the elements inside square brackets [], separated by commas.                       L=[]             # creates an empty list                      L=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]               # creates a list with numeric values                      fruits = [\"kiwi\", \"pineapple\", \"cherry\", \"orange\"] # creates a list with string values                      mix=[\"India\", 12, 34.5]         # creates a list with mixed data types                      nested_list[[1, 2, 3], 12, 5, 6]              # creates a nested list                  A nested list is a type of list that contains another list as its element.                    Indexing in Lists                  Lists are indexed, which means each element has a unique position. The index starts at 0 for the first element, 1 for the                  second, and so on. Negative indexing starts from the right to left with -1 being the last element.

Just specify the index value with the new element to be added.                     fruits[1] = \"blueberry\"                    print(fruits)  # Output: ['kiwi', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'orange']               Adding Elements               You can add elements to a list by using the append(), insert(), and extend() methods.                Using append() Function               You can only add one element at a time with append(). If you want to add multiple elements using append(), you               need to use loops. Tuples can also be added to a list using append() because tuples cannot be changed after they're               created. Unlike sets, you can add lists to an existing list using the append() function.                    # Adding elements using append() function                    fruits.append(\"strawberry\")                    print(fruits)               Output:                     ['kiwi', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'orange', 'strawberry']               Using insert() Function               The append() function adds an element only to the end of a list. To add an element at a specific position, you need to               use the insert() function. Unlike append(), which takes only one argument (the value to add), insert() requires               two arguments: the position where you want to insert the element and the value itself.                     fruits.insert(2, \"banana\")                    print(fruits)               Output:                     ['kiwi', 'blueberry', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange', 'strawberry']               Using extend() Function               The extend() method is used to add multiple elements to the end of a list at the same time.                     # Adding elements using extend() function                    fruits1=['apple', 'mango']                    fruits.extend(fruits1)                    print(fruits)               Output:                     ['kiwi', 'blueberry', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange', 'strawberry', 'apple', 'mango']                     186     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Removing List Elements                  You can remove elements from the list by using 'remove' and 'pop' functions.                    Using remove() Function                  The remove function deletes the first occurrence of the specified value from the list.                       # Removing element using remove() function                      fruits.remove(\"cherry\")                       print(fruits)                  Output:                       ['kiwi', 'blueberry', 'banana', 'orange', 'strawberry', 'apple', 'mango']                   Using pop() Function                  The pop() function removes and returns the element at the specified position (index). If no index is specified, it removes                  and returns the last element.                       # Removing element using pop() function                      fruits.pop(3)                       print(fruits)                  Output:                       ['kiwi', 'blueberry', 'banana', 'strawberry', 'apple', 'mango']                            Operations on Tuple                    Similar to the list, we can also perform the same operations on the tuples.                    Creating a Tuple                  You can create a tuple by placing all the elements inside parentheses (), separated by commas.                       city = (\"Delhi\", \"Madrid\", \"Chennai\", \"Rome\")                   Indexing in Tuple                  Tuples are indexed similarly to lists, with both positive and negative indexing.                        # Accessing elements using positive indexing                      print(city[0])  # Output: Delhi                      print(city[1])  # Output: Madrid                       # Accessing elements using negative indexing                      print(city[-1])  # Output: Rome                      print(city[-2])  # Output: Chennai                    Immutability                  Tuples cannot be modified after they are created, which means their elements remain unchanged. Nevertheless, you can                  combine two or more tuples to form a new tuple.

You can change the values using the respective keys:                     car[\"colour\"]=\"Grey\"                    print(car)   #Ouput: {'make': 'Toyota', 'model': 'Camry', 'year': 2021, 'colour': 'Grey'}               You can also add key-value pairs in an existing dictionary:                     car[\"mileage\"] = 15000                    print (car)  #Ouput: {'make': 'Toyota', 'model': 'Camry', 'year': 2021, 'colour':                    'Grey', 'mileage': 15000}                        Control Statements                 Control statements in programming languages are essential tools that allow developers to dictate the flow of execution               within their code. Depending on how the statements in a program will be executed, the flow of control in a program can               be broadly classified into three types:                • •  Sequence Statements                • •  Conditional Statements                • •  Iterative Statements                Sequence Statement               In Python, a sequence statement refers to a set of instructions that are executed in the order they appear. This is the most               straightforward form of control flow.                      188     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Program 13: To demonstrate the concept of Sequence statement                       # Perform an Addition                      num1 = 10                      num2 = 20                      result = num1 + num2                      # Display the result                       print(\"The result of\", num1, \"+\", num2, \"is:\", result)                  Output:                       The result of 10 + 20 is: 30                  Conditional Statements                  Conditional statement, also referred to as a selection statement, decision-making statement or branching statement,                  are used to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. Conditional statements in Python allow you to                  execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions.                  In Python, there are various types of conditional statements, which are as follows:                   • •  if statement                   • •  if...else statement                   • •  if…elif…else statement                   • •  Nested if statement                                                               if        False                                                                                                      Condition                  The if Statement                  The if statement is the simplest conditional statement. Here, a statement or a collection   True                  of statements within the if block are executed only if a certain condition or expression                  evaluates to True. If the condition evaluates to False, then the control of execution is   Execute                  passed to the next statement after the if block.

Nested If Statement                  A nested if statement is a construct in programming where an if statement is placed within another if statement’s                  block. This allows for the evaluation of multiple conditions in a hierarchical manner. In Python, indentation is crucial for                  defining the scope of each if statement.                  The syntax of nested if statement is shown below:                       if (Test Expression1):                           if (Test Expression2):                                Indented block 1                            else:                                Indented block 2                      else:                           Indented block 3                    Program 17: To demonstrate the use of the nested if statement                      # Input the total purchase amount                      total_purchase_amount = float(input(\"Enter the total purchase amount: Rs. \"))                         # Initialize the discount rate and discounted amount                      discount_rate = 0                      discounted_amount = 0                        # Calculate the discount rate and discounted amount based on the total purchase                      amount                      if total_purchase_amount >= 10000:                          discount_rate = 0.10  # 10% discount                          print(f\"Congratulations!

A loop is used to execute instructions or a block of code                  multiple times, without writing it repeatedly. A sequence of instructions when repeated for a number of times or until                  a condition is true is called a loop.                  In Python, there are two types of conditional statements, which are as follows:                   • •  The for loop                    • •  The while loop                   The for Loop                                                                                                 for each element                  A for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you                 in sequence                  want to execute a block of code. It iterates over a sequence (such as                  a list, tuple, string, or range) and executes the block of code for each   Last element   True                  element in the sequence.                                                  reached?

It is commonly used with for loops to iterate over                  a specific range of numbers. The syntax of the range function is as follows:                       range(start, stop, step)                  where,                    • •  start: Starting number of the sequence.                   • •  stop: Generate numbers up to, but not including the last number.                   • •  step: Difference between each number in the sequence.                  Python use range( ) function in three ways:                   1.     range(stop): This generates a sequence of numbers from 0 up to the specified stop value but not including it.                      It implicitly starts from 0 and increments by 1.

For this purpose, jumping statements are used in               Python. Python offers different jumping statements—break and continue, which are used within the loop.                The break Statement               The break is a keyword in Python which is used for bringing the program control out of the loop. The break statement               halts the execution of a loop and the program flow switches to the statement after the loop. A single break statement               will break out of only one loop.               The syntax of the break statement is as follows:                     #loop statement                         break                      196     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Program 23: To demonstrate the use of the break statement using for loop                       for number in range(0, 10):                           if(number == 5):                              break                           print('Number is:', number)                      print('The loop exits!!!')

The continue Statement                  The continue statement is used inside loops. When a continue statement is encountered inside a loop, then the control                  of the program jumps to the beginning of the loop for next iteration, skipping the execution of rest of the statements of                  the loop for the current iteration.

It serves as a lightweight and versatile means of organising data into rows and columns, akin to a spreadsheet or a                  database table. In its simplest form, each line of a CSV file represents a single record, with individual data fields separated                  by commas. However, CSV files offer flexibility in delimiters, allowing for the use of alternative separators like semicolons                  or tabs. Typically, the first row of a CSV file contains headers, defining the names of each column, while subsequent                  rows hold the corresponding data entries. Due to its text-based nature, CSV files are platform-independent and easily                  readable by both humans and machines. This simplicity, combined with its compatibility with various programming                  languages and tools, makes CSV a go-to choice for data interchange, storage, and analysis across diverse domains such                  as finance, research, and software development. There are various ways by which you can create a CSV file, such as Excel                  (by saving a spreadsheet with .csv extension).                   For example, the CSV file contains the following data:                      Customer_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, City                      1, Akash, Patel, Mumbai                      2, Priya, Sharma, Delhi                      3, Aarav, Singh, Jaipur                      4, Neha, Trivedi, Ahmedabad                      5, Rahul, Mehta, Bangalore                  Some basic operations of CSV files are as follows:                    • •    Importing the CSV library: In Python, the csv module provides functionality to work with CSV files. It includes                      classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format.                           import csv                   • •    Opening a CSV file in reading mode: When opening a file in reading mode (‘r’), you are telling Python that you                      only intend to read from the file, not modify it. The csv.reader() function then reads the contents of the file line                      by line. Note that, you have already created CSV file that you want to open. For example, Customer.csv.                        Program 25: To opening a CSV file in reading mode                       import csv                      with open('Customer.csv', 'r') as file:                          reader = csv.reader(file)                          for row in reader:                               # display data                   • •    Opening a CSV File in writing mode: When opening a file in writing mode (‘w’), you are telling Python that you                      intend to write to the file. If the file already exists, it will be truncated (emptied) first. If it doesn’t exist, a new file will                      be created.                       Program 26: To opening a CSV file in writing mode                       import csv                      with open('Customer.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:                           writer = csv.writer(file)                            # Write rows here                   • •    Closing a CSV file: In Python, it is important to close files after you have finished working with them. However,                      using the with statement automatically closes the file when the block is exited, so you don’t have to worry about                      explicitly closing it.                                                                                           Python Programming     199","• •    Writing rows to a CSV file: You can use the writerows() method to write multiple rows to a CSV file at once.                   Each row should be a list of values. This function will replace all existing data in the CSV file.                     Program 27: To write data to a CSV file row by row                    import csv                   # Open the CSV file in write mode                   with open(\"Customer.csv\", mode='w', newline='') as file:                       writer = csv.writer(file)                        # Write the header row                       writer.writerow([\"Customer_ID\", \"First_Name\", \"Last_Name\", \"City\"])                       while True:                           # Accept customer details from the user                            C_ID = input(\"Enter the Customer ID (or type 'exit' to finish): \")                           if C_ID.lower() == 'exit':                               break                           Fname = input(\"Enter first name: \")                           Lname = input(\"Enter last name: \")                            City_Name = input(\"Enter city: \")                           # Write the customer details to the CSV file                           writer.writerow([C_ID, Fname, Lname, City_Name])                   Output:                    Enter the Customer ID (or type 'exit' to finish): 1                   Enter first name: Aishwarya                   Enter last name: Iyer                   Enter city: Chennai                   Enter the Customer ID (or type 'exit' to finish): 2                   Enter first name: Rajesh                   Enter last name: Reddy                   Enter city: Hyderabad                   Enter the Customer ID (or type 'exit' to finish): exit                • •    Append rows to a CSV file: Appending a row to an existing CSV file involves opening the file in append mode                   (‘a’), and writing a single row of data to it. You can achieve this using the csv.writer object’s writerow() method.                     Program 28: To write multiple rows in one go to a CSV file.                    import csv                   data =[['3', 'Sneha', 'Gupta', 'Kolkata'], ['4', 'Neha', 'Trivedi', 'Ahmedabad'],                   ['5', 'Rahul', 'Mehta', 'Bangalore']]                    with open('Customer.csv', 'a', newline='') as file:                         writer = csv.writer(file)                         writer.writerows(data)                         200     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","with open('Customer.csv', 'r') as file:                           reader = csv.reader(file)                           for row in reader:                                print(row)                      Output:                       ['Customer_ID', 'First_Name', 'Last_Name', 'City']                      ['1', 'Aishwarya', 'Iyer', 'Chennai']                      ['2', 'Rajesh', 'Reddy', 'Hyderabad']                      ['3', 'Sneha', 'Gupta', 'Kolkata']                      ['4', 'Neha', 'Trivedi', 'Ahmedabad']                      ['5', 'Rahul', 'Mehta', 'Bangalore']                                    Brainy Fact                           In artificial intelligence and machine learning, CSV files are frequently used to store datasets for training                        models. The data is typically arranged in rows and columns, with each column representing a variable or                        feature and each row representing an instance or example.                               Understanding Libraries                   In Python, libraries refer to collections of pre-written code modules or functions that you can use to perform specific                  tasks without having to write the code from scratch. These libraries are designed to be reused in different projects that                  makes the development easier by providing various ready-to-use solutions for particular tasks.                                         NumPy                     Scikit-learn                   Pandas                                            In Python, functions are organised within libraries similar to how the library stores books on different subjects. Python                  libraries organise functions into different categories, such as math, web development, data analysis, machine learning,                  etc. These libraries can be imported into Python programs to access their functionalities and tools.                                                                                           Python Programming     201","For example, if you want to use a specific function like sqrt(), pow(), abs(), or sin() in Python, you have to tell               Python that you want to use the math library where this function is stored. You do this by adding the line 'import math'               at the beginning of your program. This lets you access and use all the helpful tools that the math library offers, including               the ‘sqrt()’ function.               Python offers a wide range of libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matpoltlib, Scikit-Learn, etc. for various purposes that               make Python a versatile language. With these libraries, you can do various tasks, such as web development, data analysis,               machine learning, scientific computing, etc.                          Introduction to NumPy                NumPy is the short form of Numerical Python. It is a fundamental library in Python that is used for performing numerical               computation. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a variety of mathematical functions to operate on these               data  structures efficiently. Its array-based data  structures and operations execution make it very useful for various               applications, such as data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, etc.               In NumPy, there are several types of arrays, which are as follows:                 • •    One-dimensional  Arrays (1D Arrays): These arrays  contain  elements arranged  in a  single row  or  column.                   One-dimensional arrays are created using the numpy.array() function with a Python list or tuple as input.                     Program 29: To demonstrate the use of 1D array                     import numpy as np                    arr_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])                    print(arr_1d)                     Output:                    [1 2 3 4 5]                • •    Two-dimensional Arrays (2D Arrays): Two-dimensional arrays are arranged in rows and columns, forming a grid-                   like structure. Two-dimensional arrays are created using nested lists or by reshaping a one-dimensional array.                     Program 30: To demonstrate the use of 2D array                     import numpy as np                    arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])                    print(arr_2d)                     Output:                    [[1 2 3]                    [4 5 6]                    [7 8 9]]                • •    Multi-dimensional Arrays (nD Arrays): These arrays have more than two dimensions, which helps in complex data                   representations. Multi-dimensional arrays can be created using nested lists or by reshaping existing arrays.

For installing NumPy, you need to open your terminal or command prompt and run                  the following command:                                                               pip install numpy                    NumPy Library in Artificial Intelligence                  Let us understand why and where we can use the NumPy library in Artificial Intelligence with the help of an example.                  Suppose, you have a dataset containing daily temperature readings from weather stations across different cities. You can                  utilise NumPy arrays to efficiently manage and analyse this data.                  With NumPy's array operations, you can easily perform the following tasks:                    • •  Calculating the average temperature for each city over the recorded days.                   • •  Finding the total temperature recorded for each day across all cities.                   • •  Determining the overall average temperature across all cities and days.                   • •  Identifying the highest and lowest temperatures recorded.                  NumPy's array operations streamline these computations that enables you to handle large datasets with ease. This                  makes NumPy an indispensable tool for processing and analysing data in different fields.

The name \"Pandas\" has a reference to               both \"Panel Data\", and \"Python Data Analysis\". It provides data structures and functions that make it easy to work with               structured data, such as tabular data (for example Excel spreadsheets or SQL tables). Pandas is built on top of NumPy,               another Python library for numerical computing, and it extends its functionality by providing high-level data structures               and powerful tools for data manipulation, cleaning, filtering, grouping, merging, etc. Its adaptability and user-friendly               interface make this an essential tool for data analysts, scientists, and engineers who are working on structured data.                      206     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","ACCESS       Name  City  Age  Score                                                          101  Naresh  Gujarat  41  88.0                                               MODIFY     102  Aryan  Chennai  28  79.0                                                          103  Pawan  Mumbai  33  01.0                                                                 Jaipur                                                 ADD      104 Anirudh  Gurgaon  34 35  80.0                                                             Karan                                                                        68.0                                                          105                                                SORT      106  Dinesh  Delhi  31  61.0                                                FILTER                                                DELETE                       You can install Pandas using pip. For installing Pandas, you need to open your terminal or command prompt and run                  the following command:                                                               pip install pandas                    Pandas Library in Artificial Intelligence                  The Pandas library plays a crucial role in Artificial Intelligence and data science workflows. It provides powerful and flexible                  tools for data manipulation and analysis, which are essential for preparing and exploring datasets used in AI models.                   Let us understand why and where we can use the Pandas library in Artificial Intelligence with the help of an example.                  Consider a dataset containing information about student performance, including grades, attendance, extracurricular                  activities, and demographic details. Pandas can be leveraged to import the dataset, compute statistical summaries, and                  conduct in-depth analyses to understand the factors influencing academic success.                  Pandas' powerful data manipulation capabilities enable educators and administrators to identify trends, correlations,                  and patterns within the student body. By examining variables such as attendance rates, participation in extracurricular                  activities, and socio-economic backgrounds, schools can gain insights into factors affecting student achievement and                  tailor interventions to support student success.                   Pandas provides powerful capabilities for data manipulation and aggregation by simplifying the execution of complex                  analyses. These capabilities play  a  vital role in AI and  data-driven  decision-making, allowing  businesses  to  derive                  actionable insights from their data with ease.                    Data Structure of Pandas                  Pandas  provides two primary data  structures: Series and  DataFrame,  which  are used to store and  manipulate data                  efficiently.                   Series                  Series represents a one-dimensional labelled array capable of holding various datatypes in a series (integer, float, string,                  Python objects, etc.). Each element in a series has an index label, which can be used to access the elements. By default,                  Series have numeric data labels starting from zero, with each value associated with an index label.

When it comes to indexing, Pandas series are significantly slower than NumPy                      arrays, which have very fast indexing capabilities.

It consists of rows and columns, where each column can have a different data type (like integers, floats, strings, etc.).               Some examples of a DataFrame are: class’s result, menu items in a restaurant, or a train's reservation chart, etc.                                           Index      Name        Test 1     Test 2     Test 3                                            0      Amit           92          75         79                                            1      Yash           81          85         84                                             2      Rohan          76          72         85                                            3      Devesh         78          83         90                                             4      Nihar          92          87         87                Creating a DataFrame               There are several ways depending on the data source and structure by which you can create a dataframe in Pandas.               Some most common method for creating a DataFrame are:                • •    From Lists or Arrays: You can create a DataFrame by passing a list or a NumPy array to the pd.DataFrame()                   constructor.

This two-dimensional format mirrors the structure of a typical spreadsheet or a database table. Each column in a               DataFrame represents a different variable or feature, while each row corresponds to a single observation or data point               or record.               You can perform some fundamental operations on rows and columns, which are as follows:                • •    Selection: DataFrames allow us to select specific rows or columns based on various criteria. This selection can be                   done using labels (column names) or indices (row numbers) or through boolean indexing based on conditions.                • •    Addition: New columns or rows can be added to a DataFrame to incorporate additional information or derived                   features. These additions can be based on existing data within the DataFrame or computed using external sources.                • •    Deletion: DataFrames enable the removal of rows or columns that are not needed for analysis. This process helps                   in cleaning and preparing the data for further processing.                To perform these operation on DataFrame, we need to first create a DataFrame.

Understanding Missing Values               Understanding missing values in a DataFrame is crucial for data analysis, cleaning and preprocessing. Missing values,               often denoted as NaN (Not a Number) or None, can occur due to various reasons such as data entry errors, incomplete               data,  or data  transformation processes. For example, while reviews for  a product  online, some customers may not               provide feedback on every aspect of the product if they did not use all of its features. Dealing with missing values is an               essential step in data cleaning and preprocessing.                The isnull() function in Pandas is used to detect missing or NaN (Not a Number) values within a DataFrame. It returns               a DataFrame of the same shape as the original DataFrame, where each element is a boolean value indicating whether it's               missing (True) or not (False). The isnull() function returns True for missing values and False for non-missing values.                                   Employee Name      Salary                 Employee Name      Salary                                  Rohit              50000                  False              False                                  Pankaj             52000      isnull()    False              False                                 Vivan              NaN                    False              True                                  Chirag             53000                  False              False                                 Sanjay             NaN                    False              True                You can count the number of missing values in each column or row.                • •  df.isnull().sum(): Returns the number of missing values in each column.                • •  df.isnull().sum(axis=1): Returns the number of missing values in each row.                There are several ways by which you can handle missing values in DataFrame:                • •    Imputation: Imputation involves replacing missing values with a specific value. Common strategies include replacing                   missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the column. This method helps in retaining the structure of the                   dataset and avoids losing valuable information.               •   Pandas provides methods like fillna() to perform imputation. For example, you can fill the missing values in a                   •                   DataFrame df with the mean of each column using df.fillna(df.mean()).                         218     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","• •    Dropping: Dropping involves removing rows or columns containing missing values. This method is useful when                      the missing values are sparse and dropping them doesn't significantly impact the analysis.                  •     Pandas provides the dropna() function to drop rows or columns with missing values. For example, you can drop                      rows with any missing values in a DataFrame df using df.dropna().                   • •    Interpolation: Interpolation involves estimating missing values based on existing data. Pandas provides interpolation                      methods such as interpolate() to estimate missing values. For example, you can perform linear interpolation                      on a DataFrame df using df.interpolate(). This method is particularly useful for time series or ordered data                      where missing values can be inferred from neighbouring values.                    Program 54: To fill the missing value in the DataFrame                       import pandas as pd                      import numpy as np                      # Define a dictionary containing data with some missing values                      data = {                          'Name': ['Adit', 'Ekam', 'Sakshi', 'Anu'],                          'Age': [27, np.nan, 25, 30],                          'Address': ['Delhi', 'Kanpur', np.nan, 'Indore'],                          'Qualification': ['M.Sc.', 'MA', 'MCA', 'Ph.D.']                      }                      # Convert the dictionary into a DataFrame                       df = pd.DataFrame(data)                      # Display the original DataFrame                       print(\"Original DataFrame:\")                      print(df)                      # Finding any missing value in a column                       print(\"\\nMissing values in each column:\")                      print(df.isnull().sum())                      # Finding the total number of NaN values                       print(\"\\nTotal number of NaN values:\")                      print(df.isnull().sum().sum())                      # Deleting entire row with NaN values                       df_dropped = df.dropna()                      print(\"\\nDataFrame after dropping rows with NaN values:\")                      print(df_dropped)                       # Filling NaN values with mean in the 'Age' column and 'Chennai' in the 'Address'                      column                      # The mean value is rounded to an integer                      df_filled = df.fillna({'Age': round(df['Age'].mean()), 'Address': 'Chennai'})                      print(\"\\nDataFrame after filling NaN values:\")                       print(df_filled)                                                                                            Python Programming     219","Output:                   Original DataFrame:                         Name   Age Address Qualification                   0    Adit  27.0   Delhi           M.Sc.                   1    Ekam   NaN  Kanpur            MA                   2  Sakshi  25.0     NaN            MCA                   3     Anu  30.0  Indore           Ph.D.                    Missing values in each column:                   Name             0                   Age              1                   Address          1                   Qualification    0                   dtype: int64                   Total number of NaN values:                    2                    DataFrame after dropping rows with NaN values:                      Name   Age Address Qualification                   0  Adit  27.0   Delhi           M.Sc.                   3   Anu  30.0  Indore           Ph.D.                    DataFrame after filling NaN values:                        Name   Age  Address Qualification                    0    Adit  27.0    Delhi           M.Sc.                   1    Ekam  27.0   Kanpur            MA                   2  Sakshi  25.0  Chennai            MCA                   3     Anu  30.0   Indore           Ph.D.                Attributes of DataFrames               In Pandas, attributes are properties that describe various aspects of the DataFrame's structure and content.

You can import a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame using the read_csv() function. The syntax of the read_csv()               function is:                                                     pd.read_csv(\"filename.csv\")                where, filename.csv is the name of the file with .csv extension that you want to import.                The pd.read_csv() function in pandas is quite versatile and allows you to specify various parameters to customise               how the CSV file is read. Some commonly used parameters are as follows:                • •  filepath: The path to the CSV file.                • •    sep: The delimiter to use for separating columns. These delimiters can be a comma, semicolon, tab, or any other                   character. The default value for ‘sep’ is a comma.                • •    header: It specifies which row to use as column names. ‘header=0’ means the column names are taken from the                   first line of the file. By default, ‘header=0’.                • •  index_col: It specifies which column to use as the row labels.                • •  dtype: A dictionary where keys are column names and values are data types.                 • •  encoding: It specifies the encoding to use for reading the file.                • •  compression: It specifies the compression mode for reading compressed files.

It is often used as a beginner's dataset for learning               classification algorithms and data visualisation methods. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with               four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These samples belong to three species of iris:               Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each species has 50 samples.               The goal of using this dataset is typically to develop and train classification models that can accurately predict the species               of an iris flower based on its measurements. The dataset is often split into training and testing sets, with a portion of the               data reserved for training the model and the remaining portion used to evaluate the model’s performance.                      224     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","The Iris dataset has become a standard benchmark for testing new machine learning algorithms, especially in the field of                  pattern recognition and classification. It’s often used to demonstrate techniques such as k-nearest neighbours, decision                  trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.

It's often considered the \"Hello, World!\" of machine learning due to its long-standing use in                        teaching statistical techniques and algorithms. With its simplicity and clear structure, it's a great starting                        point for newcomers to understand key data science concepts.                     The Iris dataset is ordered by species. The structure of the dataset is as follows:                   • •  Samples 0-49: Iris-Setosa (label 0)                    • •  Samples 50-99: Iris-Versicolor (label 1)                   • •  Samples 100-149: Iris-Virginica (label 2)                  Let us understand how to work with this dataset.                   Loading the Iris Dataset                  The Iris dataset is included as one of the default datasets in scikit-learn. You can load it using the load_iris() function                  from the sklearn.datasets module. This dataset is readily available for use without needing to download or import it                  separately.                    Program 58: To load the IRIS dataset                       # load dataset                      from sklearn.datasets import load_iris                       iris = load_iris()                      print(iris.data[:10])  # print the first 10 lines of the dataset                  Output:                      [[5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2]                       [4.9 3.  1.4 0.2]                       [4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2]                       [4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2]                        [5.  3.6 1.4 0.2]                       [5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4]                                                                                          Python Programming     225","[4.6 3.4 1.4 0.3]                    [5.  3.4 1.5 0.2]                    [4.4 2.9 1.4 0.2]                     [4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1]]               In the above code, we first load the Iris dataset using the load_iris() function and store the dataset in the iris               variable. Then, the code prints the first 10 lines of the dataset. Here, each row represents an iris flower and each column               represents a feature (or a measurement of the flower). The format of the data is sepal length, sepal width, petal length,               petal width (in cm). iris.data[:10] uses Python slicing to select the first 10 rows of the feature array. The syntax               [:10] means \"from the start up to, but not including, the 10th index\", which effectively gives the first 10 rows (0-9 rows).                Separating Dataset into Feature and Target Value               Splitting data into training and testing sets is a critical step in machine learning to evaluate the performance of your               model on unseen data. Typically, you use a portion of your data to train the model and the rest to test its performance.               In the context of supervised learning, it is common practice to separate the dataset into features and target values. The               description of these values is as follows:                 • •    Features values: Features are the variables or attributes that describe the characteristics of the data samples.                   For example, in the Iris dataset, the features are the measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length,                   and petal width. These features are used as inputs to the machine learning model to make predictions or                   classifications.                • •    Target values: The target values, also known as labels or classes, are the values we want the model to predict or                   classify. For example, in the Iris dataset, the target values represent the species of each iris flower: Setosa, Versicolor,                   or Virginica. The model learns to associate patterns in the features with the corresponding target values during the                   training process.                  Program 59: To separate the data into features and target values for IRIS dataset                     # load dataset                    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris                    iris = load_iris()                     # separate the data into features and target                    X = iris.data                    y = iris.target               Let us understand the above code:               X = iris.data                • •  This statement assigns the feature data of the Iris dataset to the variable X.                • •    iris.data contains the measurements for the features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of the                   Iris flowers.                • •    X will be a NumPy array where each row corresponds to a sample (flower) and each column corresponds to a feature.               Y = iris.target                 • •    This statement assigns the target labels of the Iris dataset to the variable y, i.e. Y will hold the labels that the machine                   will learn to predict.                • •  iris.target contains the labels for the species of the Iris flowers.                • •    Y will be a NumPy array where each element is the species label for the corresponding row in X.

Splitting Data for Training and Testing Set                  Splitting data into training and testing sets is a critical step in machine learning to evaluate the performance of your                  model on unseen data. Typically, you use a portion of your data to train the model and the rest to test its performance.                  The train_test_split function is a machine learning tool that divides a dataset into two parts: one for training the model                  and another for testing the model. The description for training data and testing data is as follows:                   • •    Training data (X_train, y_train): This portion of the dataset is utilised to train the model. This data is used to train                      the model to identify patterns and relationships.                   • •    Testing data (X_test, y_test): This portion of the dataset is used to evaluate how well the model learns from the                      training data. The model is evaluated on this data to determine how well it can predict outcomes for new, previously                      unseen data.                                                                                            Python Programming     227","Splitting data into training and testing sets is essential in machine learning for several reasons:                • •    Evaluation of model performance: By splitting the dataset, you can evaluate how well your model generalises                   to new, unseen data. The testing set serves as a proxy for real-world data, allowing you to assess the model’s                   performance accurately.                • •    Avoiding overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model learns to memorise the training data’s patterns instead of                   learning the underlying relationships. Splitting the data ensures that you can evaluate the model’s performance on                   data it has not seen during training. If the model performs well on the testing set, it indicates that it has learned to                   generalise rather than memorise.                • •    Model selection: When comparing different models or algorithms, it’s crucial to have a standardised testing set                   for fair comparison. Splitting the data ensures that each model is evaluated on the same set of unseen examples,                   allowing you to make informed decisions about which model performs best.

One of the most important and commonly               used method is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.                K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple classification algorithm used in supervised learning. It’s primarily employed for               classification tasks, although it can also be adapted for regression. The goal of this classifier is to assign labels to new               occurrences based on their resemblance to those in the training set.                KNN produces predictions based on the majority class of the ‘k’ nearest data points. This method is very useful for small               to medium-sized datasets and is simple to apply and analyse.                      228     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Before using the KNN classifier, you need to first import the KNeighborsClassifier by using the following code:                                         from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier                  Let us now add a KNN classifier.

Metrics evaluate                  how well the model makes predictions, allowing us to better understand its usefulness and identify areas for improvement.                  Some important uses of metrics are as follows:                   • •    Model evaluation: Metrics assist in determining how well a model works on a specific dataset. Accuracy, precision,                      recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC are some of the most commonly used evaluation metrics.                   • •    Comparison: Metrics enable the comparison of many models or algorithms to identify which one performs best                      for a given task.                    • •    Validation: During model construction, metrics are used to assess the model’s performance on distinct training and                      test sets to ensure that it generalises well to new data.                    • •  Optimisation: Metrics assist hyperparameter tuning and feature selection to optimise model performance.                  There are various ways by which you can evaluate the metrics. Some commonly used ways to evaluate metrics are as                  follows:                   • •    Accuracy: This metric measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances. In general,                      an  accuracy  of  1.0  (100%)  indicates  perfect  classification,  meaning  that  all  instances  were  classified  correctly.                      Conversely, an accuracy of 0.0 (0%) indicates that none of the instances were classified correctly.

It is the ratio of correctly predicted positive                   observations to the total predicted positives.

Its code is often referred to as \"executable pseudocode.\"                          Interpreted language: Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed line by line, which                          allows for easier debugging and prototyping.                          Dynamic typing: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable when                          you create one. The type of variable is inferred at runtime.                          Extensive standard library: Python comes with a large standard library that provides a wide range of modules                          and packages for tasks such as file I/O, networking, web development, and more, reducing the need to write code                          from scratch.                           Open source: Python is open source, meaning that its source code is freely available and can be modified and                          redistributed. This fosters collaboration and innovation within the Python community.                          Object-oriented: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) programming paradigm, allowing you to                          create classes and objects, encapsulate data, and implement inheritance and polymorphism.                          Cross-platform: Python code can run on various platforms and operating systems without modification, including                          Windows, macOS, Linux, and others.                          Community support: Python has a vast and active community of developers who contribute to libraries, frameworks,                          nd resources.

Why CSV files are famous and what are some basic operations of CSV files?                    Ans.   Due to the text-based nature, CSV files are platform-independent and easily readable by both humans and machines.                         This simplicity, combined with its compatibility with various programming languages and tools, makes CSV a go-to                         choice  for  data  interchange,  storage,  and  analysis  across  diverse  domains  such  as  finance,  research,  and  software                         development.                          Some basic operations of CSV files are as follows:                            Importing the CSV library: In Python, the csv module provides functionality to work with CSV files. It includes                            classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format.                            Opening a CSV file in reading mode: When opening a file in reading mode ('r'), you  are telling Python that you                            only intend to read from the file, not modify it. The csv.reader() function then reads the contents of the file                            line by line.                            Opening a CSV File in writing mode: When opening a file in writing mode ('w'), you are telling Python that you                            intend to write to the file. If the file already exists, it will be truncated (emptied) first. If it doesn't exist, a new file                            will be created.                            Closing a CSV file: In Python, it is important to close files after you have finished working with them. However,                            using the with statement automatically closes the file when the block is exited, so you don't have to worry about                            explicitly closing it.                            Writing rows to a CSV file: You can use the writerows() method to write multiple rows to a CSV file at once.                            Each row should be a list of values.  This function will replace all existing data in the CSV file.                            Append rows to a CSV file: Appending a row to an existing CSV file involves opening the file in append mode                            ('a'), and writing a single row of data to it. You can achieve this using the csv.writer object's writerow() method.                      3.  List and explain several ways for handling missed values in a DataFrame.                    Ans.   There are several ways by which you can handle missing values in DataFrame:                            Imputation:  Imputation involves replacing missing  values with a specific value. Common strategies include                            replacing missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the column. This method helps in retaining the                            structure of the dataset and avoids losing valuable information.                            Pandas provides methods like fillna() to perform imputation. For example, you can fill missing values in a                            DataFrame df with the mean of each column using df.fillna(df.mean()).                            Dropping: Dropping involves removing rows or columns containing missing values. This method is useful when                            the missing values are sparse and dropping them doesn't significantly impact the analysis.                            Pandas provides the dropna() function to drop rows or columns with missing values. For example, you can drop                            rows with any missing values in a DataFrame df using df.dropna().                            Interpolation: Interpolation  involves estimating missing  values based on existing data.  Pandas provides                            interpolation methods such as interpolate() to estimate missing values. For example, you can perform linear                            interpolation on a DataFrame df using df.interpolate(). This method is particularly useful for time series or                            ordered data where missing values can be inferred from neighbouring values.                      4.  Explain and exemplify multiple assignments in Python.                    Ans.  Multiple assignment of variables, also known as parallel assignment, is a powerful feature in many programming                         languages that allows you to assign multiple variables at once.                         For example:                         x, y, z = 1, 2, 3                         In given code, the values 1, 2, and 3 are assigned to variables x, y, and z, respectively. This simultaneous assignment                         saves lines of code and improves readability compared to assigning each variable separately.                         Multiple assignment is not limited to simple variables. It works with any iterable data structure, including tuples, lists,                         and even custom objects that support iteration and unpacking.                                                                                            Python Programming     241","For example:                       point = (5, 10)                       x, y = point                       In the given code, the values (5, 10) are unpacked from the point tuple and assigned to variables x and y respectively                    5.  What is the use of NumPy?                  Ans.  NumPy is the short form of Numerical Python. It is a fundamental library in Python that is used for performing                       numerical computation. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a variety of mathematical functions to operate                       on these data structures efficiently. Its array-based data structures and operations execution makes it very useful for                       various applications, such as data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, etc.                 C.   Competency-based/Application-based question:                             #Interdisciplinary                        In ABC company the employees were being lectured about the evaluation of an AI model. A student was confused                       between testing and evaluation. Help him solve his problem by giving concrete points and letting him know the                       importance of various metrices for evaluation of an AI model.                  Ans.   First let us clarify the student’s doubt that testing is actually running the test cases (sample inputs to check if the                       results are accurate) on the developed model whereas evaluation is finding inference (understanding) out of what                       results have come, when test cases are run.                       Testing is actually running the model in different scenarios whereas evaluation is preparing a report of what testing                       results are pointing out.                       In machine learning, metrics are used to analyse and measure the performance of models. Metrics evaluate how well                       the model makes predictions, allowing us to better understand its usefulness and identify areas for improvement.                        Some important uses of metrics are as follows:                          Model evaluation: Metrics assist in determining how well a model works on a specific dataset. Accuracy, precision,                          recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC are some of the most commonly used evaluation metrics.                          Comparison: Metrics enable the comparison of many models or algorithms to identify which one performs best                          for a given task.                          Validation: During model construction, metrics are used to assess the model's performance on distinct training                          and test sets to ensure that it generalizes well to new data.                          Optimisation: Metrics assist hyperparameter tuning and feature selection to optimize model performance.

Design Thinking                 Design  thinking  is  a  process  to  solve  problems  creatively.  It  solves  problems  by  putting  consumers'  needs  first.               So,  design  thinking  is \"people-oriented\",  which  means that  it  uses evidence  of  how  consumers (people)  interact               with a product or service, rather than how organisations think they will handle it. The essence of design thinking is               human-centric and user-specific.               To be truly people-oriented, designers observe how people use products or services, and further refine products or               services to improve the customer experience. This is the \"iteration\" part of design thinking.               The design thinking ideology asserts that practical, user-centric problem-solving methods can bring innovation, and               innovation can bring diversity and competitive advantage. This process consists of five different stages, as shown below:                                                                   Empathise                                                                Develop a deep                                                               understanding of                                                                the challenge                                                    Test                                                   Engage in a                                                 continuous short-cycle       Define                                                 innovation process to      Clearly articulate the                                                 continually improve          problem you                                                   your design                want to solve                                                          Prototype          Ideate                                                      Design a prototype    Brainstorm potential                                                       to test all or part    solutions: select and                                                       of your solution  develop your                                                                          solution               Let us learn about them in detail.                Empathise               In the first stage, designers observe consumers to gain a deeper understanding of how they interact with or are affected by               the product or problem. Observations must be made with empathy, that is, without making any judgements or conveying               any preconceived notions about consumer needs. By understanding the person affected by a problem, you can find a more               impactful solution. Empathy observation is powerful because it can uncover issues the consumers didn’t even know they               had, or that they could not verbalise. From this point on, it is easier to understand human needs.                Define               In the second stage, you collect the observations from the first stage to define the problem to be solved. This stage is               about narrowing down the focus of the design thinking process. Think about the difficulties your consumers may face,               the problems they face again and again, and what you have learned from how they were affected by the problems. Once               you have summarised your results, you can define the problem statement.                Ideate               The next step is to gather ideas to solve the problem you identified. These brainstorming sessions can be conducted in a               small group, and team can meet in an office area that encourages creativity and collaboration, an innovation laboratory,               or the team members can work alone. The important thing is to generate many different ideas.                      250     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","The goal is to ultimately overcome cognitive fixedness and devise new and innovative ideas that solve the problems you                  identified. At the end of this process, you will have some ideas to move forward.                  Prototype                  This is the stage where an idea becomes a real solution. A prototype is a simple experimental model for a proposed                  solution. The prototype may not be perfect. The focus of the prototype is to quickly come up with a concrete version of                  the idea and see how it will be accepted by consumers. This step isn’t about perfection, but rather, experimenting with                  different ideas and seeing which parts work and which don't. Examples of prototypes include a website to test consumer                  demand for products, a 3D printed product, etc.                   Test                  Once you have made a prototype solution available to consumers, you need to observe how they interact with it. During                  this testing phase, you collect feedback about your work.                   The design thinking process is iterative. At the end of the fifth stage, you may have to return to one or more stages. Perhaps                  the test indicates that you need to develop another prototype, so, you will return to the fourth stage. Or maybe it turns out                  that you misunderstood the needs of consumers, then, you need to go back to the early stages of the process.

Identifying the Problem to Solve                   Problem-solving  is  the  process  of  defining  the  problem,  determining  the  cause  of  the  problem,  brainstorming  to                  generate possible solutions, and selecting alternatives for the most suitable solution. Problem-solving is at the core of a                  person’s daily work. Whether you are solving problems for customers (internal or external) or discovering new solutions                  to the problems you are facing, it can be large or small, simple or complex.                  Identifying a problem is more important than finding a solution to it. The Swacch Bharat Abhiyan kickstarted because                  the problem of people defecating openly was identified as the root cause of many other problems.                  The ‘Define’ phase of design thinking (identifying the problem) ensures that you fully understand the goals of the design                  project. It can help you clarify your design issues and provide a clear work goal. Without a clear problem statement, it is                  difficult to know what your goals are.                           Ideate                   Idea generation is a creative process (such as brainstorming) where designers                  generate ideas in meetings. This is the third stage of the Design thinking process.                  Participants assemble with  an open  mind and  put  forward as many ideas as   Explore       Analyse                  possible to solve problems in a convenient and judgment-free environment.    possibilities                   Ideation will help you:                     Ask the right questions and innovate, focus on the users, their needs, and your                    understanding of them.

Introduction to Capstone Project  253","Ideation Techniques               The most essential ideation techniques used to generate various ideas are brainstorm, brain dump and brainwriting. Let               us learn about them in detail.                 Brainstorm               It  is  very  popular  with  design teams because  they  can  expand  in all directions.  Although  the  team has  rules and               moderators to keep them on track, they can use out-of-the-box lateral thinking to come up with the most effective               solution to any design problem. Through brainstorming, they can take multiple approaches—the more, the better—               instead of just exploring traditional methods and encountering the obstacles that come with them. A large number of               ideas are collected so that various options are available for solving the problem.                 Brain dump               Brain dump is very similar to brainstorm, however, it is done individually. It enables the people involved to open their               hearts, put down their thoughts on a piece of paper. Participants write down their thoughts on paper or post-it notes               and then share their thoughts with the larger group at a later stage.                 Brainwriting               Brainwriting is also very similar to a brainstorming session and is called \"individual brainstorming.\" In this case, only               the most confident team members share their thoughts, while introverts keep their thoughts private. Brainwriting gives               introverts time  to  write  them  down  instead  of  sharing  their  thoughts  aloud  with  the  team.  Participants  write  their               thoughts on paper, a few minutes later, they give their notes to another participant, and then the second team member               jots down his ideas or adds on to the previous member’s ideas, and so on. In this way, all participants pass on their               records to others. After about 15 minutes, the papers are collected and are available for immediate discussion.                          Empathy Map                Empathy is the first step in design thinking because it enables designers to understand, empathise, and share user               feelings. Through empathy, we can put ourselves in consideration for others and understand how they feel about their               problems, or situations.                Before we begin to figure out what the problem is or try to solve it, it’s always a good idea to “walk a mile from the               user’s point of view” and understand the user. A very useful tool to do this is the Empathy Map. An Empathy Map is a               collaborative visualisation used to clarify our understanding of a specific type of user. It helps to:                   Create a common understanding of user needs.                   Help in decision-making.                   Deepen understanding and gain insight into user behavior.               The traditional Empathy Map is divided into 4 quadrants (Says, Thinks, Does, and Feels), with the user or person in the               middle. Empathy Maps provide an overview of the user as a whole and are not sequential.                   The Says quadrant contains what the user says aloud in an interview.                    The Thinks quadrant contains what the user is thinking about his/her experience.                  The Does quadrant depicts the actions of the user.                    The Feels quadrant denotes the user’s emotional state, often represented as an adjective along with a short sentence                  for context.                     254     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Empathy Map                                                            SAYS                THINKS                                                                       USER                                                            DOES                    FEELS                       To create an Empathy Map about a user, first, draw the grid. Secondly, add the observations in the respective quadrants.                  These observations can be written directly in the quadrant, or one sticky note per observation can be added to each                  quadrant. Let’s see an example, as given below.

I am feeling frustrated.                   As the name suggests, Empathy Maps simply help us build empathy with our end users. When based on real data and                  when combined with other mapping methods, they can:                     Remove bias from our designs and align the team on a single, shared understanding of the user.                    Discover weaknesses in our research.                     Uncover user needs that the user themselves may not even be aware of.                     Understand what drives users’ behaviours.                    Guide us towards meaningful innovation.

Sustainable Development Goals                The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are also termed as the Global Goals. These goals were adopted by the               United Nations in 2015. The goals were adopted in New York as a stand for humanity, as a universal call to take action               to solve the problems of poverty, malnourishment, poor climate, and hygiene throughout the world and bring peace,               equality, growth, availability of energy resources, and partnership to achieve a well balanced world.               The SDG goals are interrelated as they affect each other, and one cannot be completely achieved without incorporating               the other.

The SDGs give us               a direction to work towards the goals to reach for equality and prosperity we are looking for in the entire world. The               countries have to collaborate for the development of all and prioritise taking those countries along, that do not have               appropriate resources for the SDGs and work for a healthy world overall.                        256     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Goal 1: No Poverty                                                                           NO                                                                                                            1 POVERTY                  Poverty is one of the greatest challenge that the world has to overcome for many decades. Various                  institutions are helping to reach this goal and they have seen success too. The poverty rate has                  dropped drastically since 1990, but overall, there are still so many people struggling even with the                  most basic human needs.                  At present, more than 700 million people are living in extremely poor conditions, and the count is higher than in 2019.                  Though poverty has dropped overall, the number of people facing a dearth of basic facilities is still very high.                  Extreme poverty is seen in Sub-Saharan countries, and poverty is decreasing in East Asian countries. China and India                  have been the most successful of all, in uplifting the people out of poverty.                  Pointing out the same, the SDGs have directed themselves to eradicate poverty as much as possible, saying that there                  should be no one below the poverty line after 2030. The goal is to work for the vulnerable and poorest of the poor                  groups.                    Goal 2: Zero Hunger                  People are getting better nutrition all over the world because of improvements in agricultural productivity. Poor countries                  like Central and East Asia and Latin America that used to suffer from famines and hunger have made improvements in                  providing appropriate nutrition to their populations. Somehow, many countries are still facing the issue of hunger for                  their people.                      ZERO          Worldwide,  more  than  800 million people  are  undernourished,  and  over  90 million children  are                  2 HUNGER                                   dangerously malnourished. Food insecurity has increased in African countries, and a lot needs to                                   be done to manage it. Even South American countries are working to uplift themselves from food                                   scarcity because their children are undernourished. Thus, the United Nations has considered it and                                   made “zero hunger\" one of its goals.                  The SDGs aim to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030, making sure all people—especially children—have                  sufficient and nutritious food all year.                  This SDG will require consistent support for the farmers by their government and the employment of all the means, like                  providing technological access, markets, farm implements, fertilisers, and pesticides, to increase farm productivity. This                  SDG also promotes international cooperation to increase farmers' access to techniques for increasing productivity.

For any country to develop and prosper, we need healthy citizens. The United Nations has underlined                  its importance by making it its goal. This SDG aims to provide good nutrition and medical facilities                  for people to overcome various communicable and non-communicable diseases. Health and good nutrition are the aims                  of this SDG which cannot be achieved without alleviating poverty hence it also shows the interconnectedness of SDG                  goals here.                  Countries are making progress and rapid improvements in health conditions, but simultaneously, some countries need                  to catch up as they have a low life expectancy and high infant mortality. Work also needs to be done to equalise the                  efforts of the government to achieve SDG so that all sections of society, whether rich or poor, are gaining the same                  benefits from the schemes and plans initiated by the government to achieve good health and well-being. The gender                  equality goal also comes into play when different sections need healthcare.                                                                                    Introduction to Capstone Project  257","Goal 4: Quality Education               The literacy rate has gone up since 2000, leading to rapid strides towards the target of universal primary education. The               net attendance ratio has increased overall, promising a more educated society. The headcount of girls is also increasing               in the schools. These are very positive indicators towards the goal of education for all.                                It  is  understood  that  without  education,  we  cannot  expect  our  society  to  become  efficient,  and                  QUALITY                4 EDUCATION     thus education promises a developed and stable future. Therefore, it has been made one of the                                SDGs. At times, working on this SDG becomes difficult due to wars, emergencies, epidemics, or                                famines. Recent wars like the Russo-Ukrainian War and the Israel-Gaza War have led to a decrease                                in the number of students, but efforts are still ongoing to provide students with the highest quality                                education.                This ensures that all girls and boys complete free primary and secondary schooling by 2030.               Children from poor households are generally devoid of educational opportunities. The SDG aims to provide quality               vocational training to pupils, irrespective of gender and economic status, leading to universal access to higher and               quality education. This SDG automatically interrelates with the Gender Equality SDG, as everyone will have to integrate               towards the completion of this goal.                Goal 5: Gender Equality                                                                                                            GENDER               Time and again, countries have shown that the more empowered their women are, the more that   5 EQUALITY               country flourishes. Empowering women improves the overall quality of life for a family. An educated               woman, in turn, educates the entire family and becomes the reason for the prosperity of the upcoming               generation. Empowered women direct their families to a safer position, and the family unit is more               stable than the one where women remain dependent.               UNDP has encircled gender equality as its goal, and there has been remarkable progress in the past 20 years. With the               initiatives of authorities and the support of societal factors, more girls are enrolling in school and higher education.               There are more girls at different workplaces than ever. Despite the change, the discrimination against women in certain               areas is very high, and they are still paid less in certain professions. They are systematically denied equal work or equal               advantages. During times of natural disaster, migration, and war, women and children are still the most affected. This               calls for much more work that needs to be done in this direction to improve the quality of life for each gender.               Thus, it is crucial to give women rights to land, property, and sexual and reproductive rights. Modern men should be               imparted the same knowledge so that they understand the rights of women as indispensable and simultaneously fulfil               their duty to bring about a harmonious change in their mindsets.                    CLEAN WATER  Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation                6 AND SANITATION  Potable water is a very scarce resource. It is alarming how most regions of the world are facing water                                scarcity and regular droughts. Dwindling freshwater resources are a matter of concern for every                                region of the world. Desertification is increasing day by day, and it is projected that 25 percent of                                people in the world will face water shortages on a regular basis by 2050. Discarding waste in water                                bodies has made the water sources vulnerable, and it is vital to save them by any means. We must               invest in achieving universally safe and affordable drinking water so that the world population has a means of survival.               A 2015 UN report says that 4.5 billion people lacked safely managed sanitation services (with adequately disposed or               treated excreta), and 2.3 billion lacked even basic sanitation. Safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 requires               investing in adequate infrastructure, providing sanitation facilities, and encouraging hygiene. Thus, ensuring safe and               hygienic sanitation will reduce the wastage of other resources, which are important for survival.               Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy                                                                                                             AFFORDABLE AND               There is a decrease in the percentage of people without electricity. The number of people not enjoying  7 CLEAN ENERGY               energy supplies has gone down too. The prime concern is that with the increasing population, the               demand for cheap energy supplies is increasing, and over-dependence on fossil fuels for energy               generation is posing a grave danger to the climate. To counter these issues, we have to opt for clean               energy resources that are affordable both for our pockets and for the environment.                      258     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Energy resources like solar, wind, tide, and geothermal are clean sources of energy that generate electricity without                  much harm to the surroundings. Therefore, SDG 7 encourages us to work on developing resources that are vital for                  environmental parameters. Under this, we aim to achieve a cleaner and more sustainable atmosphere and fulfil energy                  requirements by 2030.                     DECENT WORK AND  Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth                  8 ECONOMIC GROWTH                                   The trend in world poverty has shown a decrease in the number of people living below the poverty                                   line over the past 25 years. Despite the global economic crises of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic                                   of 2020–21, there has been an increase in the middle class from 1991 to 2015.                                   However, widening inequalities and a lack of jobs have caused distress in the labour force. According                  to the International Labour Organisation, more than 204 million people were unemployed in 2015. The SDGs promote                  innovation that leads to new economic opportunities and sustained growth in the job market and for the nation.                  SDG 8 aims for full employment for all people, including young people, untrained labourers, and people with disabilities,                  by 2030. Everyone should receive equal pay for equal work. It is aimed at fully and efficiently utilising all productive                  resources for the nation's growth. The SDGs also focus on eliminating poverty, bonded labour, and human trafficking, as                  well as increasing job opportunities, productivity, and decent work.                    Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure                  Economic growth is critically dependent on investment in infrastructure, research, and development.   INDUSTRY, INNOVATION                  Technological progress, with an ecosystem in mind, can only be achieved through safe and scientific   9 AND INFRASTRUCTURE                  innovation. Renewable energy resources are the only feasible solution, given the increasing                  population, to control environmental degradation. Transportation and communication technologies                  also require advancements to meet the needs of the upcoming generation.                   Innovation promotes efficient energy usage. Scientific research will drive sustainable development                  by introducing new industries that align with environmental needs. Sustainable industrialisation is crucial, as it increases                  the industrial share of employment for the youth, with a progressive approach for the nation. SDG is focused on                  implementing cleaner infrastructure and technologies, with all countries collaborating based on their capabilities.                       REDUCED      Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities                  10 INEQUALITIES  Income inequalities are on the rise despite efforts from countries and their respective governments.                                    The gap between the richest and poorest countries is increasing systematically. According to the World                                   Economic Forum, the richest countries (10%) hold 76% of the entire world's wealth, whereas the poorest                                   countries only have a 2% share of global wealth. Factors like technological progress, globalisation, and                                   commodity price cycles have exacerbated economic disparities within countries.                  Regions in Africa and America face the highest income disparity, while Europe experiences the least disparity among                  countries. These widening disparities require sound policies to empower lower-income earners and promote economic                  inclusion for all, regardless of sex, race, or ethnicity.                  SDG 10 has been designed to address this issue, reduce the gap between low and high income groups, and promote                  inclusiveness across all social and political spheres of society. This goal advocates for inclusiveness in the social and political                  arenas of the country for all sections of society.                  Internationally, fiscal policies should aim to ensure an equal distribution of benefits from economic outputs among those                  who generate them.                   Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities                                                   SUSTAINABLE CITIES                  Our  society is moving towards urbanisation,  so we need  to  plan  sustainable cities for  the   11 AND COMMUNITIES                  future  that  are  full of  urban  spaces.  Cities are  becoming  megacities, with  population  booms in                  developing countries. We see slums and poor neighbourhoods within the vicinity of these high and                  well-developed urban spaces.                                                                                   Introduction to Capstone Project  259","In order to make cities sustainable, we have to work towards building cities that are greener, have open public spaces for               leisure activities, and cleaner transport. The cities should also have more career options, affordable housing, and resilient               structures that bring prosperity in an inclusive manner for all incomes and societal groups. It should have structures that               may avoid critical loss to human lives and property and are able to mitigate any emergency situation.                    RESPONSIBLE  Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production                12 CONSUMPTION                   AND PRODUCTION  The world requires urgent action for the responsible consumption and production because human                                population is increasing everday and in order to maintain this population, we need to have food. The                                food requires input in the form of fertilisers and water. Fertilisers, though increase the production,                                cause harm to the environment. Water, an already scarce resource is overutilised and needs to be               saved from further exploitation in quality and quantity. The wastage of food is actually not a feasible action any more.               So, we need to be more responsible while consumption of food, and resources used for its production.               Other resources are also being exploited at an unexpectedly fast rate due to the global demand. Inefficient production               processes for developing human wants and desires have led to wastage in existing supplies of raw materials. Thus               overall, this SDG aims to improve both the production and consumption patterns of all commodities by 2030 in order to               establish a more sustainable future for upcoming generations.                Goal 13: Climate Action                                                                                                              CLIMATE               Pollution and the unrestrained burning of fossil fuels are the major factors causing climate change   13 ACTION               worldwide.  Increasing greenhouse gas emissions  are raising the earth's temperature every day.               Greenhouse  gas emissions  are  more  than  50 percent  higher  than  in  1990. Toxic  products  from               industrial and vehicle pollution have also contributed to environmental changes, which are               increasingly unsuitable for the livelihoods of future generations. The irreversible damage caused by               plastics and nuclear wastes needs immediate attention.               Rising temperatures and climate change result in numerous natural disasters that lead to billions of dollars in losses               worldwide. Therefore, this goal aims to mobilise international and national resources to mitigate environmental damage               and work towards its possible recovery. The SDG will require political, economic, and human resources to bring about               the much-needed change for the world.                    LIFE         GOAL 14: Life Below Water                14 BELOW WATER                                Oceans are very important to the mankind as they make the planet habitable for humans and other                                forms of life. It is a vital resource which provides numerous other resources. We have to manage this                                resource in order to maintain the supplies of all other resources .                                Coastal biodiversity is used by three billion people for their livelihood and the way we are consuming                                ocean resources, it is reaching unsustainable level. So, SDG 14 aims to bring sustainable yields back to               the oceans and prevent its over-exploitation as well as address the impacts of ocean acidification. Oceans are absorbers               of carbon dioxide as well, so we must work upon their saving as they control green house gas. So protecting oceans is               directly or indirectly protecting us.                GOAL 15: Life on Land                                                                                                             LIFE               Humans depend on earthly gifts as much as they depend on the resources of the oceans. Life sustains   15 ON LAND               with the help of forests, atmosphere, land, and the creatures that inhabit them. Forests are natural               suppliers of fresh water and maintain ecological balance, crucial for sustaining life. The decrease in               forests contributes to the expansion of desert areas, known as desertification.               Statistically, 13 million  hectares  of forests  are lost  or destroyed every year. Even with legislation               aimed at conserving natural forests, species continue to decline. Wildlife trafficking further threatens animal life, posing               risks to human survival.               Therefore, SDG 15 encourages universal action to address these challenges exacerbated by changing lifestyles. This will               secure life-supporting factors such as food, water, atmosphere, land, and climate, ultimately promoting a healthy and               peaceful life for all.                          260     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","PEACE, JUSTICE  Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions                  16 AND STRONG                      INSTITUTIONS  We cannot hope for sustainable development without peace, stability, human rights, and effective                                   governance based on the rule of law. Yet, our world is increasingly divided. We want peace and                                   justice for humanity and are looking for strong institutions to achieve this. Some regions fall into                                   an endless cycle of conflict and violence, while others are peaceful and prosperous. Therefore, all                                   countries must take appropriate actions to combat these situations and foster the much-needed                  growth of a sustainable society that encourages positive change for future generations.                  SDG 16 aims to reduce all forms of injustice and violence and promote a world governed by laws and order, resulting in                  institutions that govern people uniformly and in the most productive manner.

Improving access to technology and knowledge with ever-improving scientific means will take our initiatives and ideas                  further. Coordinating such activities with developing nations will bring about the changes needed by the world. We need                  improvements in debt situations, pollution levels, equality, and partnerships to make this planet sustainable for future                  generations.

Which SDG is aimed at combating the processes that lead to the wastage of resources and the depletion                           of existing supplies of raw materials on Earth?                                       Brainy Fact                          The concept of SDGs originated at the Rio+20 Summit in 2012, the largest summit in UN history.                        Colombia and Guatemala suggested establishing new goals to succeed the Millennium Development                        Goals, which were initiated in 2000 with the aim of halving poverty by 2015. This objective has been                        achieved, with poverty, defined as living on less than $1.25 a day, reduced by half. Setting such goals                        proves effective, as they help organisations and countries align their agendas and prioritise funding in                        a complex world.                        The new goals resulted from a three-year process that included 83 national surveys and engaged                        over 7 million people, marking the most extensive consultation in UN history. A report indicates that                        Sweden is most likely to achieve these goals first, with Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Switzerland                        following closely behind.

A capstone project is a comprehensive, independent,               and final project undertaken as a part of the curriculum designed to assess the skills, knowledge, and expertise a student               has acquired. Such a project often involves researching a topic, evaluating a new technique or method, developing a               health plan, researching a character or event in history, or even the composition of a sketch or play.               No matter what type of project you choose to undertake, the result is the same. You can demonstrate your understanding               of the course material and your readiness to enter the professional  world to kickstart your career. It's a rewarding               experience if it's done well.                So, a capstone project provides an opportunity for students to integrate all the knowledge learnt during the course and               demonstrate it. Ideally, a great capstone project is one that:                •   You have great interest and passion for               •   Has practical usage/value                •   Doable in a particular timeframe               •   Contemporary               •   And helps in your career advancement.                                                                                         #Digital Literacy                           Video Session                       Scan the QR code or visit the following link to watch the video: What is a Capstone Project?                      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBs2Vb5Hf54                      After watching the video, answer the following question:                      Define Capstone Project? What is its purpose?                       Some of the examples of capstone projects in AI that you can develop are as follows:               •   Studying images to diagnose diseases,               •   Forecasting student results,                •     Creating a chatbot for the school admin department or counsellor to handle parents’/students’ queries using IBM                   Watson or Google Dialogflow,                •   Image Classifier,               •   Analysing social media to assess emotions,               •   Using regression to predict a trend.                Problem Decomposition               Solving real-life problems is complicated. During coding, we follow problem decomposition methodology that can be               applied to real-life problems as well. Here, we break down a complex problem into a series of small, more manageable               problems.                          262     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","The process of making pizza can be split into sub-problems:                                                                   Make Pizza                                                Make and                                                                           Spread                         Make Crust     Spread Sauce   Spread Cheese      Toppings          Bake            Slice                   Steps for problem decomposition are as follows:                  1.  Understand the problem and express the problem in your own words:                      •  Understand the required inputs and outputs.                      •  Ask questions for clarity (in class, these questions may be directed to the teacher, however, you can also ask                         yourself or your colleagues).                  2.  Break down the problem into several big parts. Write them down on a paper.                  3.  Divide any larger complicated part into smaller parts. Continue this until all parts are small.                  4.  Code the smaller parts one by one. Use the following methodology:                       •  Analyse how to implement the code.                      •  Write the code/query.                      •  Test each code individually.                      •  Fix the problem(s), if any.                  Imagine you want to create your first website. How would you decompose this task? Think about the following while                  decomposing:                      •  What would be the name of the website?                      •  What colour combination can be used?                      •  How many web pages are to be included on the website?                       •  Who will be the target audience?                      •  What kind of images are to be posted on the website?                      •  What video/audio would be included?                      •  Which software is to be used for website development?                      •  How will you test your website?                       •  Debug and make improvements.                   AI - Project Cycle                  Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence is one of the most transformative technologies. Every AI project goes through these six steps:                                          Problem                     Data                      Data                                        Scoping                  Collection                Exploration                                           AI Modelling               Evaluation                Deployment                                                                                     Introduction to Capstone Project  263","Problem Scoping               The beginning of any project requires describing the problem, which               is done in the problem-defining phase of the project life cycle. It is a               crucial stage that requires in-depth research of the problem, so that               the desired solution is well-written in an absolute understandable               form. This helps progressively in all the following stages of the project               life cycle,  and  is also used  to  trace  back  any  missed out  features               that was initially planned to implement in the AI model. Successful               implementation of the AI model is critically dependent on this stage               of the AI life cycle.                                                       Data Collection                                                 Once the problem is identified and defined, we then begin to collect the data for                                                 it. The data that needs to be collected is identified and recorded using machines                                                 that record real-world signals for AI model to work successfully. Data acquisition                                                 is followed by data cleansing, that drops the irrelevant information with respect                                                 to the problem at hand. The inputs are then digitised for processing by the AI                                                 model in place.                     Data Exploration               Data  exploration serves as a fundamental  initial phase in data-driven projects, aimed at  deeply understanding the               dataset's structure,  characteristics, and  underlying  insights. This critical  process involves summarising essential               statistics such as data types, distributions, and handling missing values,               alongside conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to unveil patterns,               relationships, and anomalies. Utilising various visualisation techniques               such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots enables analysts to               visually grasp  data  distributions and  correlations, thereby guiding               preprocessing decisions like outlier treatment and feature engineering.               By laying this groundwork, data  exploration  ensures subsequent               analytical and modeling phases are built upon a robust comprehension               of the dataset's intricacies,  empowering  data-driven decisions  with               clarity and reliability.                                                          AI Modelling                                                         This is the  phase of implementation  of the  AI model using suitable                                                         platforms, programming languages, and constructs. An AI model is a                                                         program that has been trained on a set of data to recognise certain                                                         patterns or make certain decisions without further human intervention.                                                         They apply different algorithms to relevant data inputs to achieve the                                                         tasks, or output, they’ve been programmed for. This model is developed                                                         to  solve  the  problem  defined  in  the  first  phase.  The  model  is  then               trained with the training data. The training is iterative in nature, so that the system is prepared for the most unexpected               scenarios. This produces a refined model ready to be evaluated in the upcoming phase.                      264     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Evaluation                  The designed and tested model is now to be checked for its real-world                  execution. The AI model is now given test cases and test data to check,                  to see if it works accurately in real life and uncovers the errors that might                  have been left hidden in the modelling and training phase. The trained                  and tested model is then reformed based on the unprecedented outputs                  that are encountered during evaluation phase. Sometimes the defined                  parameters need tunings and adjustments to suit the problem in hand.                                                 Deployment                                               After the modelling and evaluation phase, the AI model is deployed or implemented                                               in real-life scenarios. The model is then integrated with existing systems. The new                                               application is then utilised and upgraded as, and when some unprecedented                                               scenarios cause some undesirable results. The model could be working dynamically                                               in an online environment as well as offline, like reporting things to the manager.                                                Understanding the nature of a problem provides insight into the components and                                               attributes of  the  yet-to-be-implemented  solutions. A good  understanding  of  a                  problem, guides future decisions to make at the later project stages, especially decisions such as determining if an AI                  solution is even feasible. At the core of every AI model, is \"finding patterns in data\". If the data shows no patterns, then                  most probably, the problem cannot be solved using AI.                   A successful problem-defining process requires a basic analysis and evaluation of the project-related problems, their                  reasons and methods. Finding the right problem definition is usually an iterative process. It can reveal more questions                  and points to consider that would have been ignored without the problem definition process. The questions below                  serve as a reference point for a thorough analysis of the problem and the problems that surround it. Just spending time                  answering the following questions can save you weeks and months working on problems that proved impossible for                  previously unknown reasons:                  •   What is the problem that needs to be resolved?                  •   Why do you need a solution to your problem?                   •   How should we work on the solution to the problem?                  •   Which aspects of the problem does the AI model solve?                   •   How do I need to interact with the solution to the problem?                  •   Which category of data will be involved? (Classification)                  •   How much or how many? (Regression)                   •   Can the data be grouped? (Clustering)                  •   Is there any unusual pattern in the data? (Anomaly Detection)                   •   Which option should be given to the customer? (Recommendation)                  It is essential to determine which of these questions you’re asking and in what way answering them helps solve your                  problem.

Short answer type questions.                      1.  What is Design Thinking?                    Ans.  Design thinking is a process to solve problems creatively. It solves problems by putting consumers' needs first. So,                         design thinking is \"people-oriented\", which means that it uses evidence of how consumers (people) interact with a                         product or service, rather than how organisations think they will handle it.                      268     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","2.

What is an Empathy Map? How does it help?                      Ans.  An Empathy Map is a collaborative visualisation used to clarify our understanding of a specific type of user.                            It helps:                              To create a common understanding of user needs.                              It helps in decision-making.                              It also helps in deepen understanding and gaining insight into user behaviour.                        4.  What is SDG Goal 10?                       Ans.  Reduced Inequalities: Income inequalities are on the rise despite all efforts from the countries and their respective                           governments. The gap between the richest and poorest countries is increasing systematically. According to world                           economic forum, the richest countries(10%) hold 76% of the entire world wealth whereas the poorest countries                           only have a share of 2% of the entire wealth.                         5.  What is problem decomposition?                      Ans.  Complex problems cannot be solved in one go. So, we try to simplify the complex problem to analyse it. This is                           known as Problem Decomposition. Here, we break down a complex problem into a series of small, more manageable                           problems.                   B.   Long answer type questions.                        1.  What does four quadrants in the Empathy Map imply?                      Ans.  The traditional Empathy Map is divided into 4 quadrants (Says, Thinks, Does, and Feels), with the user or person in                           the middle. Empathy Maps provide an overview of the user as a whole and are not sequential.                              The Says quadrant contains what the user says aloud in an interview.                              The Thinks quadrant contains what the user is thinking about his/her experience.                              The Does quadrant depicts the actions of the user.                               The Feels quadrant denotes the user’s emotional state, often represented as an adjective along with a short                              sentence for context.                        2.  Elaborate the five different stages of design thinking.                      Ans.  The five different stages of design thinking are given below:                              Empathise: In the first stage, designers observe consumers to gain a deeper understanding of how they interact                              with or are affected by the product or problem. Observations must be made with empathy, that is, without                              making any judgements or conveying any preconceived notions about consumer needs. Empathy observation                              is powerful because it can uncover issues the consumers didn’t even know they had or that they could not                              verbalise. From this point on, it is easier to understand human needs.                              Define: In the second stage, you collect the observations from the first stage to define the problem to be                              solved. Think about the difficulties your consumers may face, the problems they face again and again, and what                              you have learned from how they were affected by the problems. Once you have summarised your results, you                              can define the problem statement.                              Ideate: The next step is to gather ideas to solve the problem you identified. These brainstorming sessions                              can be conducted in a small group, and your team can meet in an office area that encourages creativity and                              collaboration,  an innovation laboratory, or the team members can work alone. The important thing is  to                              generate many different ideas. At the end of this process, you will have some ideas to move forward.                                                                                 Introduction to Capstone Project  269","Prototype: This is the stage where an idea becomes a real solution. A prototype is a simple experimental model                            for a proposed solution. The prototype may not be perfect. The focus of the prototype is to quickly come up                            with a concrete version of the idea and see how it will be accepted by consumers. Examples of prototypes                            include a website to test consumer demand for products, a 3D printed product, etc.                           Test: Once you have made prototype solution available to consumers, you need to observe how they interact                            with it. During this testing phase, you collect feedback about your work.                             The design thinking process is iterative. At the end of the fifth stage, you may have to return to one or more                            other stages. Perhaps the test indicates that you need to develop another prototype, so, you will return to the                            stage. Or maybe it turns out that you misunderstood the needs of consumers, then, you need to go back to the                            early stages of the process.                      3.  What is the purpose of the Ideation stage?                    Ans.    Ask the right questions and innovate, focus on your users, their needs, and your understanding of them.                           Combine the views and strengths of team members.                           Get rid of the obvious solutions in your mind and let the team surpass them.                      4.

Competency-based/Application-based questions:                        #Experiential Learning                       1.   After learning the importance of design thinking process in the present era of model making, Neerja was tempted                         to avoid the prototyping phase in order to do the same during AI project development. Is she right? Can we skip                         prototyping stage of design thinking? Yes or No. Please Elaborate.                     Ans.   We cannot go ahead without prototyping because a prototype gives a hint of the actual product that the designer                         intends to build. It also gets us the first glimpse of the AI model that will be functional and how it will be used by                         consumers. The concrete version of the idea of the designer and AI developer is shown in the prototype which                         builds a solid pathway for the development to proceed ahead.                      2.   The term \"sustainable development\" was indeed coined several decades ago, gaining widespread recognition with                         the publication of the Brundtland Report, also known as \"Our Common Future,\" by the World Commission on                         Environment and Development in 1987. This means the Term “Sustainable Development” have been around since                         few decades but the Sustainable Development Goals are planned now. Why?                     Ans.  While the concept of sustainable development has been around for decades, the formulation of specific goals like                         the SDGs required a combination of evolving, understanding, global collaboration, scientific advancements, policy                         development, increased awareness, and learning from past initiatives. After a suitable framework was developed                         the SDGs were put in practice with clear intentions and final results for developed as well as developing nations.                     270     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Assertion and Reasoning Questions:                        Direction: Questions 3-5, consist of two statements – Assertion (A) and Reasoning (R).

It is a well-known fact that               Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally driven by data. AI involves transforming large volumes of raw data into               actionable information that has practical value and can be utilised effectively.                                                Data Literacy                  Data  literacy  involves  the  ability  to  find  and  use  data  proficiently.  This  encompasses  skills  like  collecting  data,               organising it, checking its quality, analysing it, understanding the results, and using it ethically. Data can be structured,               semi-structured, or unstructured. It should be properly collected, organised, and analysed to ensure that the input               for AI models is valid and appropriate.                      276     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","AI data analysis employs AI techniques and data science to enhance the processes of cleaning, inspecting, and                  modelling over both structured and unstructured data. The main goal is to extract valuable information that can aid                  in decision-making and drawing conclusions.                            Data Collection                    Data collection lets you record past events, so you can use data analysis                  to find patterns. From these patterns, you can build predictive models                  using machine learning to spot trends and predict future changes.                  Data collection means gathering data from many sources, both offline                  and online. Collecting large amount of data can be the hardest part of a                  machine learning project, especially on a large scale. The amount of data                  you need depends on the number of features in the data set. It’s best to                  collect as much data as possible for accurate predictions. You can start                  with small batches of data and see how the model performs. It’s important             DATA                  to collect diverse data to ensure your model covers various scenarios.                  The quantity of data also depends on, how complex your model is. For                  simple tasks like, license plate detection, small batches of data might be                  enough. But for more complex tasks like, medical AI, you will need a lot of data. Before collecting data, data scientists                  need to understand the problem, the best solution, and the data requirements. Based on these requirements, they                  identify the data sources and collect the data. Data is essential for any project, and it is needed throughout the                  project’s development. Therefore, identifying data needs, collecting data, and analysing it repeatedly.                   Data is the main requirement for data collection methods. In any type of research or company operations, collecting                  data serves primarily to support the identification of important variables, performance being the most important                  among them. Thus, the process of collecting data plays a vital role almost in every field. Depending on the kind of                  data being collected, there are two main categories of data collection methods: primary and secondary.                   Primary Data Source                  A primary data source refers to the original source from which data is collected firsthand. This data is obtained                  directly from its origin, without any intermediary sources or interpretations. Primary data sources include surveys,                  interviews, observations, experiments, and any other method where data is collected directly by the researcher or                  organisation for a specific purpose. This type of data is considered valuable because it is tailored as per the specific                  research or business needs and is often more accurate and relevant than secondary data, which is obtained from                  sources which have already interpreted or analysed the original data.

Secondary Data Source               Secondary data sources provide information that has been gathered, processed, and published by someone else.               This data can be obtained from a variety of sources, including research articles, books, reports, and internet databases,               and is commonly utilised in research, analysis, and decision-making. Using secondary data sources might save time               and resources because the data has already been collected and processed, but it is critical to assess the data’s               reliability and relevance to ensure it meets the research or analytical requirements.

Brainy Fact                          Here are some fun facts about data:                           • To download all of the information from the Internet it would take 181 million years.                           • Every two days, we generate as much data as we did from the beginning of time until 2003.                           • There are almost as many digital information bits as there are stars in the universe.                            • Less than 0.5 percent of the data we generate is ever used or evaluated.                           • According to PragmaticWorks, poor-quality data costs global firms between 20 and 35 percent of                          their operating revenue.                           • If you burn all the data created in one day onto DVDs, you could stack them on top of each other and                          reach the moon twice.                               Exploring Data                    Exploration, one of the first steps in data preparation, is a way to know data before working with it. Exploring data                  involves familiarising oneself with the data, and understanding its value—whether it is usual, unusual, widely distributed,                  or extreme. This process not only helps in understanding the dataset better but also provides an opportunity to detect                  and rectify any data issues that might affect the analysis results. Outliers are data points that significantly differ from                  the majority of the data in a dataset. They can indicate variability in the measurement, experimental errors, or novel                  phenomena. By addressing these problems during the exploration phase, one ensures that the conclusions drawn                  from the analysis are reliable and accurate. Data exploration uses statistical methods and visualisation tools to:                     • Evaluate the size and quality of your data.                     • Detect outliers or anomalies.                      • Identify possible links between data components, files, and tables.                     • Look for similarity, patterns, relationships, and outliers.                      • Determine the relationships between different variables.                  Data exploration can be applied in a variety of areas, including banking, healthcare, retail, and marketing.                                                                         Data Literacy—Data Collection to Data Analysis  279","Levels of Measurement                                                    Levels of               The method used to measure a collection of data                        Measurement               is known as the level of measurement. Not all data               can  be  handled in same manner.  It  makes sense to               classify data  sets according  to several  criteria.  Some   Quantitative              Qualitative               are quantitative, others are qualitative. Some datasets               are continuous, whereas others are discrete. Qualitative               data might be either nominal or ordinal. Quantitative               data can also be categorised into: interval and ratio.   Discrete  Continuous    Nominal       Ordinal               The four levels of measurement:                                                                  Nominal         Ordinal       Interval      Ratio                 Categorises and labels variables                Ranks categories in order                Has known, equal intervals                 Has a true or meaningful zero                Note that a true zero refers to a scale where 0 indicates the absence of something.                Nominal               In nominal measurement, the numerical values represent a unique “name” of the attribute. The cases may be ordered in               any manner. For example, jersey numbers in cricket are measured at the nominal level. A player with the number 20 is               not better than a player with the number 3 and is certainly not twice better whatever number 10 represents, instead the               numbers act as a label to identify different players.               Nominal variables are like labels or categories—think car brands or seasons. They can’t be ranked or used in calculations.               Examples include eye colour, gender, or smartphone brands. Even if numbers are involved, like a player’s jersey number,               they’re just identifiers, not for calculations or comparisons. True zero point does not exist in nominal data.               Examples:                                            What is your hair colour?                                               1  –  Brown            Where do you live?                  What is your gender?                       M – Male                2  –  Black                 A  –  North of the equator                       F – Female              3  –  Blonde                B  –  South of the equator                                               4  –  Grey                  C  –  Neither in the international space station                                               5  –  Other                  Ordinal               In ordinal measurement, attributes can be ordered. The distance or interval between attributes is irrelevant here.               For example, in a survey, you can code educational qualification as, 0 = secondary; 1 = senior secondary; 2 = graduation; 3               = post-graduation; 4 = PhD. In this level of measurement, higher numbers mean more education. However, is the distance               from 0 to 1 equal to 3 to 4? Of course, no. The interval between the values cannot be interpreted as an ordinal measure.               Ordinal data consists of categories arranged in a specific order, like rating a meal from “unpalatable” to “delicious.”               Although words, not numbers, are used, there’s a clear progression  from negative to positive. However, the actual               difference between each category can’t be measured. Like nominal data, ordinal data can’t be used in calculations. True               zero point does not exist in ordinal data.                      280     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","For instance, in a hotel survey, responses might be “excellent,” “good,” “satisfactory,” and “unsatisfactory,” ordered from                  best to worst. But again, the gaps between these ratings can’t be quantified. Similarly, grading systems use letters to                  rank performance, but without additional context, it’s impossible to determine the precise difference between grades.                  Examples:                      Grades:                    A+  –  Outstanding          How do you feel today?

For example, if we measure temperature (in                  Fahrenheit), the distance between 30–40 is equal to the distance between 70–80. The interval between the values is                  interpretable. Interval level data can be used in calculations, but any comparisons cannot be done. 80°C is not four times                  hotter than 20°C (and 80° F is not four times hotter than 20°F). The ratio of 80:20 (or four to one) doesn’t matter.                  Interval level data shares similarities with ordinal data as it maintains a clear order, but what differs is, the differences                  between values can be measured. Like, nominal and ordinal data, there is no true point in interval data.                  Examples:                             Temperature          IQ score                       Income ranges                            90°                            80°                                                      40     100     160          `19-29k   `30-39k   `40-49k                            70°                    Ratio                  When measuring ratio, there is always an absolute zero or true zero point that makes sense. This means that you can use                  a ratio variable to construct a significant fraction (or ratio). Weight is a variable of proportion. In applied social research,                  most “number” variables ratios. For example, the number of clients for a product. You can have zero customers and it                  makes sense to say, “we had twice as many customers last year as compared to what we have this year.”                  Ratio  scale  data,  is  like  interval  scale  data,  features  a  true  zero  point  and  allows  meaningful  ratio  calculations.  For                  instance, consider the scores of a statistics final exam: 80, 68, 20, and 92 (out of 100). These scores can be ordered from                  lowest to highest (20, 68, 80, 92) or vice versa, with the differences between scores holding significance. For example,                  92 is 24 more than 68. Ratios can also be calculated, such as stating that 80 is four times 20. In this context, adding,                  subtracting, multiplying, and dividing the variables is permissible.

Unlike the                  mean and median, the mode can be used with both numerical and categorical data. A dataset can have one mode                  (unimodal), more than one mode (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode at all if no number repeats.                  In statistics, the mode is the value that appears most often in a given list of numbers.

Variance and Standard Deviation                   Measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) provide the central value of the data set. Variance and                  standard  deviation  are  measures  of  dispersion  (quartile,  percentile,  range).  They  provide  information  about  the                  distribution of data around the center.                  In this section, we will learn two other measures of dispersion: variance and standard deviation.                    Variance                  Variance measures the distance of each number in the data set from the mean and also from every other number in                  the set. Variance is often depicted by the symbol: σ  so variance of x will be denoted by σx 2                                                               2                  Calculating the variance:                                                                        10 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 4                                                      1     2     3    4   5   6  = 48                                                  10,  8,  10, 8, 8, 4                                                                           48 ÷ n ⇒ 48 ÷ 6                                                      n = 6                                                                              Mean = 8                     • The variance represents how far the data  in your sample  are                    grouped around the mean.                                            high variance                     • Data sets with low variance have data grouped closely around the                    mean.                      • Data sets with high variance have data grouped far from the mean.

Standard Deviation               Standard deviation is a statistics measure, that measures the degree of dispersion of a dataset relative to its average.               When determining the deviation of each data point from the average, the standard deviation is calculated as the               square root of the variance. If the data points are farther from the mean, the deviation in the data would be greater               therefore, the data, would be more spread out, the larger is the standard deviation.               Using the previous example, we have to calculate the square root of the variance in order to find the standard derivation.

Data scientists investigate the outliers to see                        if they are caused by data entry errors, measurement errors, or actual abnormalities, and then decide                        whether to remove, correct, or maintain them based on their significance to the analysis.

Representation of Data                   Statistics is a branch of Mathematics that involves the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and                  organisation of data. It is used to make informed decisions and understand the world through data. To accomplish                  this goal, statisticians summarise a significant amount of data in a compact format that yields relevant results. Without                  displaying values for each observation (from populations), it is possible to portray the data in a concise manner while                  retaining its significance using techniques known as ‘data representation’. It may also be defined as a technique for                  presenting enormous amounts of data in a way that allows the user to quickly and easily interpret the most relevant                  information.                  There are two broad categories of data representation techniques:                     • Non-Graphical  Technique:  Non-graphical techniques include tabular and case forms. This is an older data                    representation format that is unsuitable for huge datasets. Non-graphical strategies are ineffective when we want                    to make decisions based on a set of data.

The human brain is more comfortable coping with complex and massive amounts of material                  when it is represented visually.  Data visualisation refers to the graphical or pictorial depiction of data using                  graphs, charts, and other tools.

The Data Visualisation Catalogue is a project developed by Severino Ribecca to create a (non-                    code-based) library of different information visualisation types. The website serves as a learning                    and inspiration resource for those working with data visualisation.                          Introduction to Matplotlib                 The purpose of data visualisation is to simplify the interpretation of complex data. Visualisation in Python can be               accomplished using the Matplotlib library. This extensive library enables the creation of various plots, such as line               plots, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more. Matplotlib is highly customisable, giving users detailed control               over the appearance of the plots. The ‘pyplot,’ submodule of Matplotlib, offers an interface like MATLAB and includes               numerous convenient functions that simplify the process of creating basic plots.               Install Matplotlib library in Python by giving the following command:                  pip install matplotlib                 or                 python – m pip install – U matplotlib               While writing a Python program, we import the pyplot module of matplotlib library by giving the following command:                  import matplotlib.pyplot               Some of the common functions of Matplotlib library with their descriptions is given below:                   Function Name                       Description                   title( )                            Adds title to the chart/graph                   xlabel( )                           Gives label for x-axis                   ylabel( )                           Gives label for y-axis                  xlim( )                             Gives the value limit for x-axis                   ylim( )                             Gives the value limit for y-axis                   xticks( )                           Places the tick marks on the x-axis                  yticks( )                           Places the tick marks on the y-axis                   show( )                             Displays the graph on the screen                   savefig(\"address\")                  Saves the graph to the given address                  figure(figsize = value in tuple   Sets the size of the plot where the graph is drawn.

Psychologically, our brain experiences less                       stress when viewing graphical representations compared to examining the same data in a numerical                       list format.                     Line Graph                  A line graph is a strong tool for representing continuous data on a numbered axis. It enables us to visually represent                  trends and changes in data points across time. Line graphs are appropriate for data that can take any value within a                  defined range. The line may slope upwards, suggesting an increase, or downwards, indicating a decrease, reflecting                  changes in the data over time.

Scatterplot               A scatter plot or scatter chart is used to visualise the relationship between two variables in a dataset. It utilises an x-y               coordinate system where each data point is represented by a dot. A trend line may be added to a scatter plot in some               instances.

A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data                  structure with labelled axis (rows and columns).                        300     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","• ‘games_played’ extracts the column named ‘Games Played’ from the DataFrame, creating a series that contains the                    number of games played.                    • ‘total_scores’ extracts the column named ‘Total Scores’ from the DataFrame, creating a series that contains the total scores.                     • These extracted series (games_played and total_scores) are then used to create a scatter plot.                    Pie Chart                  A pie chart is a circular graph divided into slices to show the relative proportions of different categories within a                  whole. Each slice's size is proportional to the quantity it represents. Pie charts are mostly used to visualise facts from                  a small dataset. There should be not more than seven categories in a pie chart. Another limitation of a Pie chart is                  that zero values can't be displayed in pie chart. However, these graphs are hard to interpret and compare facts with                  another pie chart.                  Pie charts are used to examine elements of a whole. They do not display changes over time. For example, pie charts                  may be used to suggest the achievement or failure of a product or service, display the time-period allotted to each                  subject in a class, or depict monthly spending on numerous items and services in a household. For example:                                                                                    No. of books read in a month                           Story books      No. of books read in a month                                                                                   Self-help books                                                                                     12%                           Fiction                       30                                                                                              Fiction     Fiction                                                                                              35%                           Murder Mystery                20                                               Murder Mystery                                                                                 Comic Books                                                                                  29%                     Comic Books                           Comic Books                   25                                               Self-help books                                                                                       Murder Mystery                                                                                          24%                           Self-help books               10                    The function pie() is used to plot a pie chart.

The first slice (Fiction) is exploded to highlight it explode               parameter. The ‘autopct’ parameter displays the percentage value of each slice (each label will show the percentage               value of the corresponding slice, rounded to zero decimal place), and ‘shadow’ adds a shadow effect. The ‘startangle’               parameter rotates the start of the pie chart to 140 degrees for better visual appeal.

Introduction to Matrices                The knowledge of matrices is necessary in all branches of Mathematics. Matrix is one of the most powerful tools in               Mathematics. Compared to other methods, it greatly simplifies the calculations.                In mathematics, a matrix (plural matrices) is a rectangular arrangement of numbers. The numbers are arranged in               tabular form as rows and columns.               Let us understand with the help of an example:               Ganga bought 12 oranges and 5 apples.               Hemant bought 10 oranges and 7 apples.

So, referring to the above example, matrix A is a 3 × 2 matrix. The number of elements present in a matrix                  is given by m × n ⇒ 3 × 2 = 6 elements.

It includes multiple processes to clean, transform, reduce, integrate, and normalise data:                             Data               Data             Data Reduction      Data Integration       Feature                           Cleaning        Transformation                           \& Normalisation       Selection                    1.  Data Cleaning: Businesses have abundance of data. However, not all of it is accurate                    or organised. When it comes to machine learning, if data is not sufficiently cleaned, the                    accuracy of your model is at risk. The following steps are taken to clean/prepare the                    data:                     •  Missing Data: Missing data refers to the absence of certain values in the dataset,                       which can result from various causes. To handle missing data, strategies include                       removing rows or columns with missing values, imputing missing values with                       estimates, or utilising algorithms that can manage missing data.                                                                     Data Literacy—Data Collection to Data Analysis  305","•  Outliers (extreme values): Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from most of the dataset, typically                    due to errors or uncommon occurrences. Managing outliers includes detecting and excluding them, transforming                    the data, or applying robust statistical techniques to minimise their influence.                  •  Inconsistent Data: Inconsistent data, such as typographical errors or variations in data types, is rectified to                    ensure uniformity and coherence across the dataset.                  •  Duplicate Data: Duplicate data is identified and eliminated to maintain data integrity and accuracy.                                              2.   Data Transformation: This process involves converting data into a format suitable                                               for analysis. Common techniques include normalisation, standardisation, and                                               discretisation. Normalisation scales the data to a common range, standardisation                                               adjusts the data to have a zero mean and unit variance, and discretisation converts                                               continuous data into discrete categories. Existing features may also be adjusted as                             15%                                               necessary.                              25%                                15%                                 45%                 3.  Data Reduction: This process decreases the data volume, making analysis                  easier while yielding the same or nearly the same results. It also helps to save                  storage space. Common data reduction techniques include dimensionality                  reduction (reducing the number of features in a dataset) and data compression.                                                      4.  Data Integration and Normalisation: Data from multiple sources or formats                                                 is combined or aggregated (data is presented in the form of a summary).                                                 Subsequently, the data is normalised to ensure uniform scale and distribution                                                 across all features, enhancing the effectiveness of machine learning models.                                                 Data integration is a key component of data management.                       5.   Feature Selection: This step involves choosing a subset of important features                  from the dataset. Feature selection is commonly done to eliminate irrelevant                  or redundant features from the dataset.                   Data in Modelling and Evaluation               Once data preprocessing is complete, it’s divided into two sets: the Training data and the Testing data.

Various techniques like train-test split, cross-validation, and error analysis are employed to gauge the model’s                  generalisation ability and pinpoint areas for enhancement. In the Train Test Split technique, dataset is divided into                  two sets: Training and Testing. It trains the model with the training data and assesses its performance using the                  testing data. Cross Validation ensures consistent model performance across different data subsets. You will study                  these in detail in class XII.                  Different evaluation techniques are applied depending on the data type. For classification problems, metrics such as                  accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve are commonly used. For regression tasks, metrics like Mean Squared                  Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared are frequently used.                  In today’s era, having proficiency in handling data is crucial. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence, understanding data                  allows us to leverage information effectively.

Depending  on  the  kind of  data  being  collected,  there  are  two  main categories  of  data  collection  methods:                                        and               .                     3.                  is collecting data on the Earth's surface and atmosphere through satellite.                    4.                  involves collecting, exploring, and presenting large datasets to identify patterns and trends.                     5.   High variance suggests data points are widely dispersed from the mean and to     .                    6.   Training data is            in size than testing data.                     7.   A               is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with                         labelled axis (rows and columns).                     8.                  scales the data to a common range.               C.   State whether the following statement is true or false.                    1.   It is a well-known fact that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally driven by data.                     2.   Collecting large amounts of data can be the hardest part of a machine learning project.                     3.   Primary data sources might save time and resources.                    4.   Ordinal data consists of categories arranged in a random manner.                    5.   Central tendency helps in predicting future trends and making informed decisions based on                         historical patterns.                     6.   We can have multiple mode values.                    7.   Non-graphical strategies are ineffective when we want to make decisions based on a set of data.                     8.   xlabel( ) gives the value limit for Y-axis.                                                  SECTION B (Subjective Type Questions)               A.   Short answer type questions.                      1.  Define a primary data source.                     Ans.  A primary data source refers to the original source from which data is collected firsthand. This data is obtained                         directly from its origin, without any intermediary sources or interpretations. Primary data sources include surveys,                         interviews, observations, experiments, and any other method where data is collected directly by the researcher or                         organisation for a specific purpose. This type of data is considered valuable because it is tailored to the specific                         research or business needs and is often more accurate.                      2.  How does statistical methods and visualisation tools help to explore data?                     Ans.  Data exploration use statistical methods and visualisation tools to:                         •  Evaluate the size and quality of the data.                         •  Detect outliers or anomalies.                         •  Identify possible links between data components, files, and tables.                         •  Look for similarity, patterns, and outliers.                         •  Determine the relationships between different variables.                      310     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","3.   What do you mean by graphical and non-graphical data representation? Why is graphical data representation                           more advantageous?                      Ans.  Non-Graphical Technique for Data Representation                           Non-graphical techniques include tabular and case forms. This is an older data representation format that is unsuitable                           for huge datasets. Non-graphical strategies are ineffective when we want to make decisions based on a set of data.                           Graphical Technique for Data Representation                           Graphs are commonly used to visualise statistical data using points, lines, dots, and other geometric shapes.                           Advantage of graphical over non-graphical data representation: The human brain is more comfortable coping                           with complex and massive amounts of material when it is represented visually. Data visualisation refers to the                           graphical or pictorial depiction of data using graphs, charts, and other tools.                        4.  What is the use of autopct parameter in a pie chart?                      Ans.  The ‘autopct’ parameter displays the percentage value of each slice. Each label will show the percentage value of                           the corresponding slice, rounded to zero decimal place.                        5.  Given the following conditions, identify which chart would you use?                           i.  Suitable for comparisons, particularly when there are numerous categories or negative values.                           ii.   Good for displaying trends, particularly small variations or data lines that cross. They are also useful with time-                              series data.                           iii.  Good for demonstrating the correlations and distributions of two quantitative variables. These graphs may                              reveal positive, negative, or no associations.                           iv.  Good for demonstrating how different numbers relate to one another, such as comparing the sizes or percentages                              of various categories in a data set.

What is the transpose of a matrix? Give an example.                      Ans.  A matrix obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of a matrix. Transpose of a matrix A is denoted by A’ or                           AT. If order of matrix A is m X n, then order of transpose of matrix A, i.e., A’ is n × m. For example:                                                                                   14                                                             12 3                                                                                                  ‘                                                                        T                                                         A =        A OR A = 24                                                                                                                                                    45 6  ×23           36   ×32                                                                                                          2.  What are the steps taken to clean/prepare data in the data preprocessing pipeline.                      Ans.  The following steps are taken to clean/prepare the data:                           •   Missing Data: Missing data refers to the absence of certain values in the dataset, which can result from various                              causes. To handle missing data, strategies include removing rows or columns with missing values, imputing                              missing values with estimates, or utilising algorithms that can manage missing data.                           •   Outliers: Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the majority of the dataset, typically due to                              errors or uncommon occurrences. Managing outliers includes detecting and excluding them, transforming the                              data, or applying robust statistical techniques to minimise their influence.                           •   Inconsistent Data: Inconsistent data, such as typographical errors or variations in data types, is rectified to                              ensure uniformity and coherence across the dataset.                           •  Duplicate Data: Duplicate data is identified and eliminated to maintain data integrity and accuracy.

Define the following:                         • pyplot                         • Semi structured data                         • Feature Selection                    Ans  •   pyplot: Data visualisation in Python can be accomplished using the Matplotlib library. The ‘pyplot’ submodule                           of Matplotlib offers a MATLAB-like interface and includes numerous convenience functions that simplify the                           process of creating basic plots.                         •  Semi structured data: Text files with an apparent pattern enabling analysis e.g. HTML files.                         •   Feature Selection: This step is part of the data preprocessing pipeline. It involves choosing a subset of important                           features from the dataset. Feature selection is commonly done to eliminate irrelevant or redundant features                           from the dataset.                      4.  When is a scatterplot suitable?                    Ans.  •   It is used to track the connections between two numerical variables. When the data are seen as a whole, the dots                           on the plot indicate both the variable's value and any trends.                         •   The scatterplot is a valuable tool for calculating correlation. Variable relationships can be categorised in a variety                           of ways, including positive or negative, strong or weak, linear or nonlinear.                          •   This graph’s strength lies in its ability to clearly depict trends, clusters, and relationships within datasets.

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that allows computers to learn and make judgments based                  on data. It involves algorithms that can identify patterns, anticipate outcomes, and improve over time without being                  specifically  coded  for  specific  tasks.  Here's  a  real-world  example,  assume  you  have  a  personal  assistant  who  can                  foresee your wants, provide solutions, and even forecast issues before they arise. This is what machine learning can                  achieve, making it a valuable tool in today's technologically advanced world.                  Machine learning has the capacity to extract information from huge datasets and perform complicated operations                  that  transform  various  industries  ranging  from  healthcare  and  banking  to  transportation  and  entertainment.  As                  researchers continue to invent and improve these algorithms, machine learning's impact on society is set to grow,                  ushering in a period of extraordinary creativity and opportunity.                            Machine Learning in a Nutshell                    Machine learning is a subdomain of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing systems that learn or improve                  performance based on the data they ingest. It is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn                  and improve automatically from experience without the need for explicit programming. It focuses on the development                  of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for itself. Data is critical for machine learning to work.                  The more data the machine is given (assuming that the data is reliable), the more accurate its prediction is. Artificial                  Intelligence is a broad word that refers to systems or machines that resemble human intelligence. A crucial distinction                  between Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is that all ML is AI, but not all AI is ML.

Additionally, some common machine               learning methods such as decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines enable this learning process.                Features of Machine Learning               Some key features of machine learning are as follows:                ●  ML interprets, analyses, and processes data to address real-world problems.               ●  It learns from data and enhances its performance over time.                ●  The technology facilitates automation and prediction based on learned patterns.                ●  It is the prevailing approach in contemporary AI.               ●  It employs data analysis, training, and sometimes human review to refine its capabilities.               ●  Unlike traditional programming, it doesn’t rely on predefined rules but learns from examples and experiences.                ●   It powers a wide range of applications across industries, from healthcare and finance to autonomous vehicles and                   recommendation systems.               However, ML is not without its challenges. Overfitting, in which models specialise too much on training data, can               result in poor performance on fresh data. Bias in training data can lead to skewed predictions, and some models               are difficult to understand, serving as black boxes. Despite these hurdles, machine learning (ML) converts data into               knowledge, allowing computers to learn, adapt, and make autonomous judgments.                          Types of Machine Learning                 Machine learning can be divided into three primary categories, each distinguished by its learning approach and nature of               the input data:                                                                • Labelled data                                                                • Direct feedback                                                                • Predict outcome                                            Supervised                                             Learning                                                                                              • No labels                           Machine                            Unsupervised                  • No feedback                           Learning                             Learning                    • Find hidden structure                                              Reinforcement                                             Learning                                                                • Decision process                                                               • Reward system                                                               • Learn series of actions               Supervised Learning               Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which machines are trained using well \"labelled\" training data,               and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged               with the correct output.                      322     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","In  supervised  learning,  the  algorithm  learns  from  labelled  data,  where  each  training  example  is  paired  with  a                  corresponding target label. The goal is to learn a mapping from input variables to output labels. During training, the                  algorithm adjusts its parameters to minimise the difference between predicted and actual labels.                  Building, expanding, and successfully implementing accurate supervised machine learning models requires time and                  technical expertise from a team of highly trained data scientists. In the real-world, supervised learning can be used for                  risk assessment, image classification, fraud detection, spam filtering, etc. Take a look at the examples below:                  Example 1:                                                                                              It is a                              INPUT RAW               Supervisor                           mango !                                 DATA        Training data set  Desired Output   OUTPUT                                                          Algorithm      Processing    Model Trained                                                          Model Training                                                                                    INPUT                  Step 1:   You provide the system with images of mangoes and tag them as mangoes. This type of input is referred to                          as labelled data.                   Step 2:   The model learns from the labelled data and next time you ask it to identify a mango, it can do it easily.                  That’s exactly how supervised learning works.                  Example 2:                   Many voice assistants, including Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, use supervised learning algorithms to process and                  interpret spoken instructions. The algorithms are trained on a dataset of labelled speech data (transcribed speech and                  text), which they then use to transcribe and interpret spoken commands.                                                      Analog Audio          Analog to Digital Audio   Pattern Recognition                                                                     Conversion                   Supervised Learning Algorithms and Their Use                   Supervised learning involves two primary algorithms: regression and classification.                  ●   Regression  algorithms  create  a  mapping  function  from  the  input  data,  allowing  us  to  predict  continuous                     outcomes.  They  are  used  if  there  is  a  relationship  between  the  input  variables  and  the  output  variables.  For                     instance, predicting house prices based on features like size and location is a task for regression.                  ●   Classification algorithms, on the other hand, involve creating a function that assigns data points to specific categories. They                     are used when the output variable is categorical, implying there are two classes such as Yes-No, Male-Female, True-False, etc.                                                                                    Machine Learning Algorithms   323","For example, classifying emails as spam or not spam uses a classification function to determine the appropriate                   category for each email.

Unsupervised Learning               As the name suggests, unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised               using training dataset. The machine learns through observation and finds patterns in data. The system will explore               the data and draw inferences from the data set to describe the hidden patterns in the unlabelled data. Unsupervised               machine learning algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labelled.               For example, if somebody gives you a basket full of different fruits and asks you to separate them, you will probably               do it based on their colour, shape, and size, right? Unsupervised learning works in the same way. For example,                            Raw Data is input                                                    Output                                         • Unknown Input     Algorithm                                        • No Training Data Set                                                  Interpretation             Processing                                                           Model Training                    Model is trained                        324     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Unsupervised Learning Algorithm and Its Uses                   Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction are common algorithms in unsupervised learning.                  Clustering  is  a  machine  learning  approach  where  the  machine  partitions  the  dataset  into  different  clusters  or                  categories based on similar characteristics.

It is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data, where the number                  of features is large relative to the number of samples. Dimensionality Reduction methods aim to simplify the dataset,                  making it easier to visualise, analyse, and model while also reducing computational complexity.                  Advantages of Unsupervised Learning:                      • Unsupervised learning is used for more complex tasks as compared to supervised learning because, in unsupervised                    learning, we don't have labelled input data.                     • Unsupervised learning is preferable as it is easy to get unlabelled data in comparison to labelled data.                  Disadvantages of Unsupervised Learning:                      • Unsupervised learning is intrinsically more difficult than supervised learning as it does not have corresponding output.                     • The result of the unsupervised learning algorithm might be less accurate as input data is not labelled, and algorithms                    do not know the exact output in advance.

The  agent  takes  actions  and                  observes the outcomes, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.                  Over  time,  through  repeated  trials  and  adjustments  to  its  strategy,  the  agent                  refines its decision-making process to achieve better performance and maximise                  its cumulative reward. This iterative approach allows the agent to learn optimal                  behaviours without explicit instructions or supervision.

The objective is to determine the most suitable function that                  characterises the connection between these variables.

It is mainly used for weather forecasting, finding the causal-effect               relationship between variables and time series modelling.               In regression tasks, there are two kinds of variables being studied: the dependent variables and the independent variables.                  • Independent variables: Quantities that can be measured directly.                   • Dependent variables: Quantities whose value depends on independent variables.               As the independent variable is adjusted, the level of the dependent variable will vary. The dependent variable is the               variable under study, and it is the variable that the regression model tries to predict. In the linear regression task, each               observation is made up of the value of the dependent variable and the value of the independent variable.                Regression is basically used when the dependent variable is of a continuous data type. The independent variables, on               the other hand, can be of any data type—continuous, nominal/categorical etc.               There are several types of regression analysis, which are as follows:                                 Random Forest                 Support Vector                Decision Tree                                 Regression                    Regression                   Regression                                                                                              Polynomial                              Linear Regression         Types of Regression                                                                                            Regression                                  Ridge Regression              Lasso Regression             Logistic Regression                   Linear Regression—Finding the Line               When we make a distribution in which there is an involvement of more than one variable, then such an analysis is               called Regression analysis.

Linear regression aims to find the best-fitting straight line through the points.               2.   If data points are closer to the line of best fit (less residual error), it means the correlation between the two                   variables is higher. That means, the relationship between the two variables is strong.                3.   The regression line is also called ‘Line of Least Squares of Errors’ because the lower the residual errors, the                   better.                4.  Each data point has one residual.                                                                                        #Digital Literacy                            Video Session                       Scan  the  QR  code  or  visit  the  following  link  to  watch  the  video:  Linear  Regression                      Algorithm                       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5RjzSK0fvY\&t=527s                                      Brainy Fact                       The least squares regression method was first published by mathematicians Legendre in 1805                      and Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1809. Both used linear regression to predict the movement of planets                      around the sun. Gauss later published an improved method in 1821.                  When Regression Analysis is Not Suitable                It’s important to understand that regression analysis may not always be suitable in certain scenarios:               ●   No Correlation: If there is no correlation between the variables, meaning they change independently of each                   other, regression analysis will not yield meaningful insights or predictions.                      330     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","●   Non-linear  Relationships:  Regression  is  effective  for  modelling  linear  relationships  but  may  not  accurately                     capture more complex, non-linear relationships. In such cases, techniques like polynomial regression or non-linear                     regression might be more appropriate.                  ●   Outliers:  Outliers,  or  extreme  data  points,  can  disproportionately  affect  the  regression  model  and  lead  to                     inaccurate predictions. It’s crucial to assess the impact of outliers and consider alternative modelling approaches                     if necessary.                  ●   Violation of Assumptions: Regression analysis depends on certain assumptions, such as linearity of relationships                     and absence of multicollinearity (high correlation between predictor variables). If these assumptions are violated,                     the regression analysis results may be unreliable.                   Linear  regression  is  a  supervised  learning  algorithm.  It  makes  use  of  one  independent  variable,  x,  to  predict  the                  outcome of a second dependent variable, y. This method finds the most accurate straight line that best describes the                  relationship between the dependent and the independent variables, with minimum error.                   Applications of Linear Regression                  Linear  regression  is  used  in  various  Artificial  Intelligence  applications.  It  has  its  limitations,  but  its  simplicity,                  interpretability, and efficiency often exceed these limitations. Real life applications of linear regression include:                  ●  Prediction of product demand                   ●  Sales forecasting                  ●  Analysing the effect of price change of a service                  ●  Predict the effect of fertiliser on crop yield                  ●  Prediction of revenue through advertisements                   ●  Predicting salary of a person based on number of years of experience                  Types of Linear Regression                   There are two types of Linear Regression, which are as follows:                  ●   Simple linear regression: It refers to the utilisation of a single independent variable for forecasting an outcome                     of a numerical dependent variable.                                                       y                                                                        x                   ●   Multiple linear regression: It demonstrates a connection between two or more independent variables and the                     associated variables that are dependent. The variables that are independent can be continuous or categorical.                     This kind of regression type allows you to forecast patterns, predict potential outcomes, and forecast the effects                     of adjustments.                                                        y                                                                        x                                                                                    Machine Learning Algorithms   331","Advantage of Linear Regression                Some advantages of linear regression are as follows:               ●  Linear regression is a simple technique and easy to implement.               ●  Efficient to train the machine on this model.                 Disadvantages of Linear Regression               Some disadvantages of linear regression are as follows:               ●  Regression analysis is sensitive to outliers as these can have a great impact on the analysis.               ●   It is quite prone to overfitting. (Overfitting means that the training of the model on data is just too good and the                   test sample size is quite small).                               Reboot                       1.

As one variable increases/decreases, the second variable too increases/decreases. For example,                     when fuel prices increase, prices of airline tickets also increase.                  ●   Negative correlation: Negative correlation is the relationship between two variables, where one variable increases                     as the second variable decreases, and vice versa. For example, more exercising leads to a decrease in body weight.                   ●   No correlation: No correlation means that there is no relationship between two variables. If the value of a variable is                     changed, another variable is not affected. For example, shirt size and monthly expense, body weight and intelligence,                     etc.                   ●   Non-linear correlation: A non-linear correlation is a correlation in which the relationship between variables may                     not always be a straight line and all the points of a scatter plot are tend to lie near a smooth curve.                   Pearson's r—Correlation Coefficient                   The degree of association between two sets of data is measured by a correlation coefficient, represented by r. It is                  also called Pearson's correlation coefficient and measures linear association between two variables. If a curved line is                  needed to state the relationship, more complicated measures of correlation should be used.                   The correlation coefficient is measured on a scale that varies from + 1 to – 1.                   ●  1 is a perfect positive correlation.                  ●  0 is no correlation (the values don't seem to be linked at all).                   ●  –1 is a perfect negative correlation.                  Pearson’s coefficient, r, is denoted by:                                                                   NΣxy–(Σx)(Σy)                                                       r =                                                                             2                                                                       2                                                                 2                                                              [NΣx  – (Σx) ][NΣy  (Σy) ]                                                                                 2                  Where,                  N = Number of Values or Elements                  x = First Score                  y = Second Score                   Σxy = Sum of the Product of First and Second Scores                   Σx = Sum of First Scores                  Σy = Sum of Second Scores                   Σx  = Sum of Square of First Scores                    2                    2                  Σy  = Sum of Square of Second Scores                  Following are the guidelines given for interpreting the Pearson’s coefficient ‘r’:                                                                 Coefficient, r                                             Strength of Association    Positive    Negative                                             Small                      .1 to .3   –0.1 to –0.3                                             Medium                     .3 to .5   –0.3 to –0.5                                              Large                      .5 to 1.0  –0.5 to –1.0                  Note that the strength of the association of the variables depends on what you are measuring and sample sizes.

As  the  age  of  a  person  increases,  the               person’s income also goes up.                Example 2: Amit is an idol student good in both academics and sports. However, after some time, he reduced his               sports activity and observed that he scored less marks in his test also. To investigate this hypothesis, he noted how he               scored in his tests, based on how many hours he played any sport before appearing in the school tests. He gathered               this  data  to  check  the  correlation  between  number  of  hours  of  his  sports  activity  and  his  tests  scores.  He  thus,               calculated the Pearson Correlation Coefficient = 0.95. Explain his observation.                Solution: 0.95 shows a positive and strong strength of association between the two variables. This means that Amit scored               better marks if he continued his sports activities. If Amit reduced his playing hours, the marks he scored also reduced.                Assumptions               There are four assumptions for Pearson's correlation coefficient which are as follows. If any of these four requirements               are not met, analysis of data using Pearson's correlation coefficient might not yield a valid result:                1.   The data type of the two variables should be continuous. Examples of such continuous variables include height                   (measured in feet and inches), temperature (measured in °C), income (measured in INR), study time (measured in                   hours), intelligence (measured through IQ score), exam performance (measured from 0 to 100), sales (measured                   in number of transactions every month), etc.                2.   There must be a linear relationship between the two variables. Create a scatterplot by plotting the two variables                   against each other. The scatterplot can then be used to check for linearity.                          336     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","The scatterplot may look something like one of the following:                               Positive Correlation          Negative Correlation         No Correlation                                3.   In statistics, outliers are data points that are significantly different from other observations. Outliers may be due                     to measurement irregularity or may indicate experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data                     set. Outliers can cause serious problems in statistical analysis. The data should not have any significant outliers.                     Outliers are single data points within your dataset that do not follow the usual pattern. The following scatterplots                     highlight the potential impact of outliers:                                                  r = 0.39                      r = 0.69                                                            Outlier                    Outlier removed                          Outliers can have a great impact on the line of best fit and the Pearson correlation coefficient, leading to very                     difficult inferences regarding the data. Therefore, it is best to have no outliers or keep them to a minimum.                  4.  The variables should be normally distributed (approximately).                    Correlation is not Causation                  The correlation is a statistical method that indicates whether a pair of variables has a linear relationship and will                  change together. It does not state the reasons for the relationship, but it tells that a relationship exists.                   Causation shows that an event is the direct result of the occurrence of another event, i.e. a causal relationship exists                  between the two events. This is also called cause and effect. For example, a speeding car leads to an accident. The                  accident is due to causation.                   Causation takes a step ahead of correlation. It states that any change in the value of one variable will definitely cause                  a change in the value of the second variable. This means that one variable makes the other happen. This is also called                  cause and effect.                   In statistics, the phrase \"correlation does not imply causation\" means that the relationship between two variables                  cannot be reasonably deduced based solely on their observed association.                   ●   \"Correlation is not causation\" means that if two things are related, does not, necessarily mean that one thing leads                     to the other.                  ●   For example, just because Indians tend to eat more in cold weather and less in hot weather does not mean that                     cold weather leads to crazy shopping for eatables.

This means no playing games or messaging                   through the phone.                          Classification                 We use classification every day, classifying vegetables as ‘good to eat’ or ‘rotten’, classifying cats as per their breed or               even classifying files as important or not important.                                 One more common example of classification is to identify spam emails. To create               an email spam filter program, a developer can train a machine learning algorithm               with a set of spam-like emails labelled “spam” and normal emails labelled “not               spam”.                The reason behind this is to train an algorithm that can identify spam emails from a set               of emails and filter out non spam emails.               In  order  to  understand  \"Classification\",  let  us  revise  the  concept  of  \"Supervised               Learning\", because classification is type of supervised learning.                Supervised learning is a subcategory of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is also known as supervised machine               learning. In supervised learning, we train the machine using well-labelled data, which means the data is already marked               with the correct answer. After that, the machine is given a new dataset (training data) so that the supervised learning               algorithm can analyse this data and produce the correct outcome.                Let us take an example of vegetables. Now, you want to create a machine that can identify the vegetables               one by one.                         338     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","To do so, the first step is to train the machine with all different vegetables one by one, which may be done as follows:                                                               ●   If shape of a vegetable is round with a depression at top and is                                                                  red in colour, then it will be labelled as tomato.                                                                ●   If  the  shape  of  a  vegetable  is  long  and  conical,  although                                                                  cylindrical  and  nearly  spherical,  and  is  orange/red  in  colour,                                                                  then it will be labelled as carrot.                                                               ●   If the shape of a vegetable is long finger-like, has a small tip at                                                                  the tapering end, and is green in colour, then it will be labelled                                                                  as a lady finger.                    Now, if you show a new vegetable in front of the machine and ask the machine to identify it, since the machine has                  already been trained from previous data, it will use the learned data wisely to classify the vegetable based on its shape                  and colour and would confirm the vegetable.                  More examples of classification problems include:                   ●  Given a handwritten character, classify it as one of the known characters.                  ●  Given recent user behaviour, classify it as churn or not.                   In  Artificial  Intelligence,  classification  is  the                  process of labelling a set of data (structured or                  unstructured) into different classes or groups   METAL          GLASS         PLASTIC         PAPER                  where we can assign a label to each class. For                  example, cities in India have different coloured                  dustbins  for  different  types  of  waste:  green                  coloured  dustbins  for  biodegradable  waste,                  blue dustbins for non-biodegradable or plastic                  waste, yellow dustbins for paper waste, and red dustbins for metallic waste. Hence, we classify the waste into four                  different categories while also labelling each category.                   How Classification Works?                  In machine learning, classification involves sorting data into specific groups or classes based on their features.                                                               Classification Process                             Classes or          Features or                               Classification        Prediction or                      Categories            Attributes            Training              Model               Inference                    Here’s an overview of the process:                      •  Classes or Categories: Data is organised into different classes or categories, each representing a distinct outcome.                    For example, a binary classification scenario has two classes: positive and negative.                     •  Features or Attributes: Each data instance is characterised by features or attributes that provide information about it.                    These features are essential for the classification model to distinguish between different classes. For example, in email                    classification, features might include words in the email, sender information, and the email subject.                                                                                   Machine Learning Algorithms   339","•  Training Data: The classification model is trained on a dataset known as training data. This dataset contains labelled                 examples, where each data instance is paired with a class label. The model learns the relationship between features                 and class labels from this data.                  • Classification Model: An algorithm or technique is used to create the classification model. The model learns from the                 training data to predict class labels for new, unseen data instances, generalising patterns and relationships from the                 training data to make accurate predictions.                  • Prediction or Inference: After training, the classification model is used to predict class labels for new data instances.                 This process, known as prediction or inference, that uses the learned patterns and relationships from the training data.

Real Life Applications of Classification               In classification, our data is categorised into a preferred and distinct number of classes while assigning label to each               class. Applications of classification in real life include:                  • Speech recognition                  • Handwriting recognition                  • Face tagging as done by Facebook                  • Detecting fraudulent transactions in banks                   • Predicting whether advertisements on a website to be clicked or not                  • Product classification                  • Document classification                                                                                           #Digital Literacy                          Video Session                     •   Scan the QR code or visit the following link to watch the video: Classification in Machine Learning                         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG-E--Ak5jg                    •   Scan the QR code or visit the following link to watch the video: Difference between                        Classification and Regression                        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rRLo4nFc3A                     After watching both the videos, answer the following questions:                    1.

What is classification model according to the video?                           340     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Brainy Fact                        One  of  the  first  algorithms  used  for  machine  learning  was  the  Naive  Bayes  classifier.  Spam                       filtering systems used Naive Bayes till 2010.                       Types of Classification                   Classification is a supervised learning concept which groups a set of data into classes. It is mainly of four types, which                  are as follows:                   •  Binary classification: It refers to classification problems/tasks that have                     only two class labels. For example, email spam detection (spam or not),                     churn  prediction  (whether  customers  will  stop  doing  business  on  a                     particular website or he will continue). In general, binary classification   x 2                     tasks involve 2 labels—normal and abnormal. For example, “no-spam”                     is  a  normal  condition  and  “spam”  is  an  abnormal  condition.  Another                     example is that “tumour not detected” is a normal state and “tumour                     detected” is an abnormal condition.                                                                                                            x 1                                                        •    Multiclass  classification:  It  implies  those  classification  tasks  that                                                             have more than two class labels. Each entity is assigned to one class                                                             without any overlap. For example, face classification, animal species                                                             classification,  optical  character  recognition.  In  contrast  to  binary                  x 2                                        classification, multiclass classification does not have the concept of                                                             normal and abnormal classes. Instead, the examples are classified as                                                             belonging to one of the several known classes.                                                                The  number  of  classes  may  be  very  large  in  some  problems.  For                                                             example,  a  model  may  tag  a  photo  as  belonging  to  one  among                                                             thousands  of  faces  in  a  face  recognition  system.  Text  translation                                     x 1                     models are also a special type of multiclass classification.                      •  Multi-label  classification:  Multi-label  classification  is  used  when  a                     situation might belong to more than one class at the same time. This                     implies that for a given input, the output may contain a collection of                     labels  instead  of  a  single  one.  For  example,  document  classification   x 2                     (where a document may be classified into various groups at the same                     time,  such  as  “science”  and  “technology”),  and  object  detection  in                     images etc.                                                                                                             x 1                                                                                       Machine Learning Algorithms   341","•   Imbalanced  classification:  Imbalanced  classification  involves  tasks                                                        associated with classification in which the distribution of classes in the                                                        dataset is strongly distorted, implying that a single class (the majority                x                 2                                                        class) surpasses the other(s). This could lead to problems throughout                                                        training since the model may get biased against the majority class while                                                        doing negatively on the minority class.                                     x 1                 K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithm               K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms in machine learning. It is a               simple, straightforward, and adaptable machine learning method. The KNN algorithm is a classifier using supervised               learning  and  non-parametric  learning  (makes  no  assumptions  about  the  original  data  distribution)  that  employs               proximity or closeness to classify or forecast the arrangement of a single data point.               KNN is most beneficial where labelled data is prohibitively expensive or difficult to gather and it can perform well in               a wide range of forecasting situations. It has a wide range of applications, including handwriting detection, picture               recognition, pattern recognition and video recognition.               While the KNN technique can be applied to both regression and classification problems, it is most commonly employed               for classification, with the assumption that similar data points are possible to find close proximity.                 Why is KNN Algorithm Required?               Assume you have a collection of coloured balls divided into three colours: red, blue, and green. If you purchase a new               ball but do not specify its colour, you will be unable to determine which colour group it belongs to. In such cases,               when the decision limits are unclear or the dataset lacks a well-defined structure, the KNN algorithm is applied.               The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method determines the colour of the ball based on proximity of new ball or datapoint.               If the new ball is close to the red colour group, it is labelled as red; if it close to the blue colour group, it is labelled as               blue; and if it close to the green colour group, it is labelled as green.                           x 2      Before K-NN                              x 2       After K-NN                              Category B                                         Category B                                                Category C                                         Category C                                                               K-NN                                         New data point                                     New data point                                                                                             assigned to                                                                                             Category B                            Category A                                        Category A                                                          x 1                                                x 1                           342     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Steps Involved in KNN                   To better understand the working of KNN algorithm, apply the following steps when using it:                  Step 1:   Load both the training and test datasets.                   Step 2:   Select the number of nearest data points (K), which can be any integer.                  Step 3:  Choose a distance metric, such as Euclidean or Manhattan distance, to determine the closeness among data points.                   Step 4:     Arrange the dataset in ascending order based on the distance values and determine the K-Nearest Neighbors.                   Step 5:   Determine the total amount of data points in every category among these K neighbors.                  Step 6:  Assign the new data point to the category having the highest number across its immediate neighbors.                   Step 7:   The model is prepared and ready for usage.                   Applications of KNN                  Some applications of KNN are as follows:                   •  Image recognition: KNN may be used to categorise photographs depending on their attributes, such as pixel                     values and colour, etc. KNN may compare the attributes of a picture with those of labelled images in the set used                     for training and classify the majority of its K-Nearest Neighbors.                  •  Spam detection: KNN can identify spam emails through the comparison of new emails to a database containing                     both spam and non-spam emails.                   •  Medical diagnosis: KNN can forecast diseases using patient information such as symptoms, medical history, and                     medical test findings. Patient information can be expressed as feature vectors, which KNN can use to produce                     forecasts by comparing them to those individuals with recognised diagnosis.                  •  Financial forecasting: KNN may be employed to anticipate stock prices and market movements using the past                     information. KNN can discover trends in previous data and forecast future market behaviour.                  •  Anomaly detection: Anomaly detection uses KNN to detect data points which are substantially distinct from the                     remaining portion of the data. It identifies points as anomalies when they are significantly different from their                     K-Nearest Neighbors.                  •   Recommendation systems: KNN can enhance recommendation systems by identifying comparable people or things.                   •  Customer segmentation: KNN may divide customers into groups according to purchase habits, demographic                     information, or other characteristics, allowing for more focused marketing campaigns.                   Advantages of KNN                  Some advantages of KNN are as follows:                  •   KNN modeling doesn't have a training period because the data itself serves as the model for future predictions.                     This makes it very efficient for quickly using the available data.                   •   KNN is also very easy to implement. The main task is to calculate the distance between different points based on                     their features. This can be done easily using distance formulas like Euclidean or Manhattan.                  •  Since there's no training period, new data can be added at any time without affecting the model.                   Limitations of KNN                  Some disadvantages of KNN are as follows:                   •     KNN is not good for large datasets because calculating distances for every data instance is very time-consuming.                                                                                     Machine Learning Algorithms   343","•     It doesn't perform well with high-dimensional data, as calculating distances for many dimensions is complex.               •     KNN is sensitive to noisy and missing data.                •     All data dimensions must be properly scaled (normalised and standardised).                For Advanced Learners               The Breast Cancer dataset from the sklearn library is a well-known dataset used for binary classification tasks. It               contains data on breast cancer cases collected by Dr. William H. Wolberg at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals. This               dataset includes features that describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the breast cancer biopsies. The               dataset consists of 569 rows with 30 numerical features. Each row corresponds to a biopsy sample, and each feature               represents a specific characteristic of the cell nuclei like mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, mean area and               so on. The target variable is binary, indicating whether the cancer is malignant (1) or benign (0).

You plan to visit around 20 tourist spots in Amritsar in three               days. How will you do this? Write down your plan.                You will most probably group the tourist spots into say 3 – 5 groups. The ones closer to each other like the Golden               Temple and Jallianwala Bagh will go in one group, while Wagah Border which is further away will be included in               another group. You do this, so that you can park your car at one spot/central location and walk around visiting all the               tourist spots in your group/cluster.                      346     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","The above can be classified as a clustering problem. Clustering, or cluster analysis, is the task of grouping a data                  set into a set of similar items. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm. As an important analysis method in machine                  learning, clustering is used to identify patterns and structures in unlabelled data sets.

Recommendation Systems                  Recommendation systems are widely used by Amazon, Netflix, Flipkart, etc. to provide automated and personalised                  recommendations for products, services and information. The technology behind the recommendation engines is                  called collaborative filtering. A cluster is formed based on the preferences of customers. Customers within each cluster                  get recommendations computed at the cluster level.

How Clustering Works?                In order to cluster the data, the following steps are conducted:               1.  Data preparation: Data preparation means including effective data features for the clustering algorithm. The data                   set must include descriptive features or any new features based on the original set that will be generated, in the                   input dataset.                2.   Creating similarity metric: The algorithm tries to understand how similar the pairs of samples are. You quantify                   the similarity between the samples by creating a similarity metric. This requires clear understanding of your data                   and how to derive similarity from the data features. For example, consider pin codes of an Indian state. If the                   difference between two pin codes is small, this represents that the two regions denoted by the pin codes are                   close to each other and have a higher similarity. When you can quantify the metric manually, it is called ‘manual                   similarity measure’.                3.  Run the clustering algorithm: A clustering algorithm uses the similarity metric developed in step 2 to cluster                   data. Clustering algorithms are able to handle processing of large datasets efficiently. However, they do need to                   compute the similarity between all pairs.                4.  Result interpretation: As clustering is unsupervised, the interpretation of results is crucial and can be handled by                   a human expert. The results are verified against expectations and if improvement is required, the above steps are                   repeated.                Types of Clustering                Clustering algorithms are quite popular. Let us learn about some of them.                Centroid-based Clustering               Centroid-based clustering  arranges  the  data into  non-hierarchical clusters.               K-means clustering is the most popular centroid-based clustering algorithm.               Centroid-based  algorithms  are  efficient  but  easily  affected  by  the  initial               conditions and outliers. This type of clustering is also called  Partitioning               Clustering.                                                       Density-based Clustering                                                   Density-based  clustering  groups  high  density  areas  into  clusters.  Hence,                                                  arbitrary-shaped distributions occur so that dense areas can be connected.                                                  The data points in the separating regions of low density are considered outliers                                                  and not assigned to clusters.                          348     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Distribution-based Clustering                  Distribution-based clustering is a clustering model in which we try to fit the                  data on the probability that it can belong to the same distribution. The                  grouping done may be normal or gaussian. Gaussian distribution is more                  popular where there are fixed number of distributions. The data is fitted in                  such a way that the distribution of data gets maximised.

A centroid is an imaginary or real location denoting the centre of the cluster. The K-means algorithm identifies K number                  of centroids, and then assigns every data point to the nearest cluster, while trying to keep the centroids as small as possible.                  The algorithm has the following steps:                   Step 1:  Decide the number of clusters (k).                  Step 2:  Select k random points from the data as centroids.                   Step 3:  Group all the points to the nearest centroid.                  Step 4:  Calculate the centroid of newly formed clusters.                  Step 5:  Repeat steps 3 and 4.                   It is a repetitive process. It will keep on executing until there is no change in the centroids of newly formed clusters or                  points remain in the same cluster or the maximum number of iterations are reached.                                                                                             #Digital Literacy                            Video Session                        Scan the QR code or visit the following link to watch the video: StatQuest: K-means Clustering                       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b5d3muPQmA                        After watching the video, answer the following question:                       What do you mean by K-means clustering according to the video?

Disadvantages of K-Means Clustering               Some of the disadvantages of K-Means Clustering are:                •  K has to be chosen manually and it is not an easy process.               •  The algorithm is dependent on initial values.               •  Outliers greatly affect the clustering process.               •  The algorithm has trouble grouping data where clusters are of fluctuating sizes and density.                          Why is Clustering Unsupervised?                 Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that automatically divides the data into clusters or groups               of similar elements. The algorithm does this without any knowledge of how the groups should look in advance. So,               clustering is rather used for the discovery of knowledge rather than for prediction. It provides an idea of natural               groupings that are within data.                         350     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Without advanced knowledge of what a cluster includes, how can a computer know where a group begins or ends? The                  answer is simple. Clustering is driven by the principle that objects within a group should be very similar to each other,                  but very different from the objects outside. The similarity function can vary across different applications, but the basic                  idea is always the same—group the data so that the related elements are placed together.

It predicts the output values based on input values.                        • Regression is basically used when the dependent variable is of a continuous data type. The independent                       variables, on the other hand, can be of any data type—continuous, nominal/categorical etc.                        • There are several types of regression analysis, random forest regression, support vector regression, decision                       tree  regression,  linear  regression,  polynomial  regression,  ridge  regression,  lasso  regression  and  logistic                       regression.                        • Classification is a supervised learning concept which groups a set of data into classes.                        • Classification is mainly of four types—binary classification, multiclass classification, multi-label classification,                       and imbalanced classification.                        • The KNN algorithm is a classifier using supervised learning and non-parametric learning (makes no assumptions                       about the original data distribution) that employs closeness to classify or forecast the arrangement of a single                       data point.                        • Clustering, or cluster analysis, is the task of grouping a data set into similar items.                        • Clustering is of four types, centroid-based clustering, density-based clustering, distribution- based clustering,                       and hierarchical clustering.                        • K-Means clustering is a powerful and widely used machine learning algorithm for partitioning datasets into                       clusters based on feature similarity.                        • The degree of association is measured by a correlation coefficient, represented by r.

Short answer type questions:                     1.  What is Machine learning?                    Ans.  Machine learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve automatically                        from experience without the need for explicit programming. It focuses on the development of computer programs that                        can access data and use it to learn for itself. Data is critical for machine learning to work. The more data the machine is                        given (assuming that the data is reliable), the more accurate is its prediction.

List any two applications of KNN.                 Ans.  Two applications of KNN are as follows:                     •     Image recognition: KNN may be used to categorise photographs depending on their attributes, such as pixel                        values and colour, etc. KNN may compare the attributes of a picture with those of labelled images in the set used for                        training and classify the majority of its K-Nearest Neighbors.                     •     Spam detection: KNN can identify spam through the comparison of new emails to a database containing both                        spam and non-spam emails.                    4.

What are the four types of correlation?                 Ans.  Four Types of correlation are:                     1.  Positive Correlation: Positive correlation is the relationship between two variables, in which both variables have a                        linear relationship. As one variable increases/decreases, the second variable too increases/decreases. For example,                        when fuel prices increase, prices of airline tickets also increase.                     2.  Negative Correlation: Negative correlation is the relationship between two variables, where one variable increases                        as the second variable decreases, and vice versa. For example, more exercising leads to a decrease in body weight.                     3.  No Correlation: No correlation means that there is no relationship between two variables. If the value of a variable is                        changed, another variable is not affected. For example, shirt size and monthly expense, body weight and intelligence,                        etc.                     4.  Non-linear Correlation: A non-linear correlation is a correlation in which all the points of a scatter plot are tend to                        lie near a smooth curve.                   6.

It is represented by a single value.  It is represented by a regression line.                   7.  What is the primary difference between classification and regression?             [CBSE Handbook]                 Ans.

Ans.  As age increases (moving along the x-axis toward greater numbers), the amount of sleep needed decreases (y-values                        decreasing). This is a negative correlation. This indicates that as individuals grow older, they generally require less sleep.                      9.  Write down any 4 limitations of KNN.                    Ans.  Some limitations of KNN are as follows:                         •   Appropriate k selection is crucial in KNN since it has a significant impact on model accuracy, requiring careful tuning.                         •    KNN  has  issues  with  imbalanced  datasets,  that  are  biased  towards  the  dominant  class  and  generate  incorrect                          projections for minority classes.                        •   KNN evaluation stage might be highly computational because it calculates distance for every training occurrence.                         •    KNN retains every piece of training data, requiring large memory resources.                     10.  What do you understand by Centroid?                    Ans.  A centroid is an imaginary or real location denoting the centre of the cluster. The K-means algorithm identifies K                        number of centroids, and then assigns every data point to the nearest cluster, while trying to keep the centroids as                        small as possible.

Outlier                    Ans:  a.  Causation: Causation shows that an event is the direct result of the occurrence of another event, i.e. a causal                           relationship exists between the two events. This is also called cause and effect. For example, a speeding car leads                           to an accident. The accident is due to causation.                        b.  Outlier: In statistics, outliers are data points that are significantly different from other observations. Outliers may                           be due to measurement irregularity or may indicate experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the                           data set. Outliers can cause serious problems in statistical analysis.                      2.  Explain Classification with example of supervised learning.                    Ans.  In Artificial Intelligence, classification is the process of labelling a set of data (structured or unstructured). into different                        classes or groups where we can assign a label to each class. In machine learning, a predictive classification model tries                        to approximately map the function from input variables to discrete output variables. The main goal is to determine                        which class/category the new data will belong to. For example, heart disease detection is a classification problem. There                        are only two classes in this case—a patient has heart disease or does not have heart disease. In this case, the classifier                        needs training data to understand how a given input variable is related to the class. Once the classifier is properly                        trained, it can be used to determine whether a particular patient has heart disease or not.

Some popular clustering algorithms are as follows:                      ●  Centroid-based Clustering: Centroid-based clustering arranges the data into non-hierarchical clusters. K-means                       clustering is the most popular centroid-based clustering algorithm. Centroid-based algorithms are efficient but easily                       affected by the initial conditions and outliers.                                           ●  Density-based Clustering: Density-based clustering groups high density areas into clusters. Hence, arbitrary-shaped                       distributions occur so that dense areas can be connected. The data points in the separating regions of low density are                       considered outliers and not assigned to clusters.                                          ●  Distribution-based Clustering: Distribution-based clustering is a clustering model in which we try to fit the data on                       the probability that it can belong to the same distribution. The grouping done may be normal or Gaussian. Gaussian                       distribution is more popular where there are fixed number of distributions. The data is fitted in such a way that the                       distribution of data gets maximised.                                     ●  Hierarchical Clustering: Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters. The aim of the algorithm is to produce a                       tiered series of nested clusters. Each cluster is different from every other cluster, and the objects within each cluster                       are mostly similar to each other.                       358     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","E F                          F                                                   A        D                               E                                                    B                                D                                                   C                                                                                          C                                                                                          B                                                                                        A                                                               I                           H                                                              H                                                                 J                         I                                                         G        K                        K                                                                                           J                                                                                  G                      4.  Why is clustering unsupervised?                    Ans.  Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that automatically divides the data into clusters or groups                        of similar elements. The algorithm does this without any knowledge of how the groups should look in advance. So,                        clustering is  rather used for the discovery of knowledge rather than for prediction. It provides an idea of natural                        groupings that are within data.                        Without advanced knowledge of what a cluster includes, how can a computer know where a group begins or ends? The                        answer is simple. Clustering is driven by the principle that objects within a group should be very similar to each other,                        but very different from the objects outside. The similarity function can vary across different applications, but the basic                        idea is always the same—group the data so that the related elements are placed together.                      5.  Why is KNN algorithm required? Explain with the help of example.                    Ans.  The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method determines the colour of the ball based on proximity of new ball or datapoint.                        If the new ball is close to the red colour group, it is labelled as red; if it close to the blue colour group, it is labelled as                        blue; and if it close to the green colour group, it is labelled as green.

Assertion(A):  Causation states that any change in the value of one variable will definitely cause a change in the value                                    of the second variable.                        Reasoning(R):  The  correlation  is  a  statistical  method  that  indicates  whether  a  pair  of  variables  has  a  quadratic                                     relationship with each other.                      4.  Assertion(A):  Linear  Regression  method  finds  the  most  accurate  straight  line  that  best  describes  the  relationship                                    between the dependent and the independent variables, with minimum error.                         Reasoning(R):  Linear Regression has its limitations, but its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency often exceed these                                     limitations.

The existence of machines is not possible without human innovation and                  efforts and the purpose of machines fails if they don’t fulfill human needs. Machines are designed to perform specific                  tasks to ease the work of humans, but they lack the understanding and adaptability of humans, which can lead to                  difficulties in communication, understanding and comprehension.                  Human-machine interaction relies on words that may not always be intuitive or user-friendly, leading to frustration, or                  inefficiency on the part of humans. Therefore, an interface that effectively bridges the gap between human intuition and                  machine functionality is crucial for enhancing interaction and usability.                           Challenges of the Human Language                   Linguistics is a study of how to strategically apply language principles and practices to achieve specific aims or purposes.                  Linguistics is widely applied in marketing, advertising, communication, education, natural language processing, and other                  fields.  Understanding  how  language  works,  (including  structure,                  semantics,  pragmatics,  and  sociolinguistics)  enables  individuals                  and organisations to modify messages, improve communication,                  and impact behaviour.                  Understanding human language is a difficult task, especially for                  those who have grown up around it. Human language is extremely                  complex, with strange expressions that appear to contradict one                  another, vocabulary that takes cultural knowledge to understand,                  and grammatical patterns that may turn simple  statements into                  complex expressions or tongue twisters. Machines require systems                  known as Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand human language.                                                                      Leveraging Linguistics and Computer Science  367","NLP is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to understand, generate, and enhance human               speech. NLP has the capacity to query data using natural language text or voice. Most of us have used NLP. For example,               NLP is at the heart of the technology, that powers virtual assistants like Oracle Digital Assistant (ODA), Siri, Cortana, and               Alexa. NLP may be used on both written text and speech data.

IBM Project Debater                Can an AI system maintain an ongoing conversation and respond to what is said with each exchange? Moreover, can an               AI defeat a human expert in an argument over a complex topic? Consider a well-known experiment to find out how AI               works with spoken and written language.               In 2012, IBM began developing Project Debater with the goal of               creating a machine capable of more than just winning debates with               humans. In other words, IBM Project Debater would listen to a series               of competing arguments made by humans and respond to them               intelligently, in addition to answering questions in human language.               IBM’s goal was to create a system that could assist individuals in               making evidence-based, bias-free decisions on complex problems,               where the answers were not evident.                A  winning  Project  Debate  could  be  prepared  and  presented  by               following the given steps:                1.

AI machine, on understanding the topic, create a vocabulary corpus and collate the data from                   its whole pool of sources.                2.  Reasoning: After the analysis, a short speech is made from different text collected from varied sources with every                   minute detail presenting a compelling argument, in logical order, using good vocabulary.                     368     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","3.

[CBSE Handbook]                                          Natural Language Processing (NLP)                   Computers excel in working with structured data, in which everything is properly organised and labelled. Unfortunately                  for machines, human language is not structured. You've spent most of your life communicating through human language.                  Your brain accomplishes this with some of the most complex neural circuitry on this planet. However, creating machines                  that can understand human language, is extremely challenging.                  NLP  involves  machines  segmenting  sentences  and  extracting  meaning  from  “tokens”  of  human  language.  Human                  language  is  difficult  and  unstructured.  Despite  being  loosely  held  together  by  grammar  constraints;  our  language                  presents information in a variety of puzzling ways. Unstructured information, unlike structured information that can                  be  organised in tables or matrices with clearly labelled rows and columns, is disorganised and difficult to comprehend.                  Consider the statements made by famous personalities:                  •  Groucho Marx: “One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas I'll never know.”                  •  Steven Wright: “I poured spot remover on my dog. Now he’s gone.”                  •  George Carlin: “I went to a bookstore and asked the saleswoman, ‘Where’s the self-help section?’ She said if she                     told me, it would defeat the purpose.”                  To deal with the “messiness” of unstructured data, computers start with one sentence at a time. The process is known                  as sentence segmentation that is sentence-based text analysis. In NLP analysis, the text data is either analysed using                  meaningful words called tokens, or analysed using sentences. Computers divide the input into small piece of information                  (tokens), which may be classified separately. NLP can deal with text tokens after they have been sorted into a structured                  format or manner based on their meaning.                                                                    Leveraging Linguistics and Computer Science  369","Entities, Relationships and Concepts               In NLP and AI, an entity is a significant piece of information or object in a text. An entity can be real-world objects such               as names, locations, organisations, or dates. They can also be defined as a noun representing a person, place, a thing               such as product name, technical phrase, or domain-specific concepts.               A relationship can be defined as a collection of two or more entities that share a strong bond with one another.               The following activities will show you how Groucho Marx’s joke can be tokenised into useful categories called entities               and relationships.

How he got into my pajamas I'll never know.”                    Now keeping this in mind, identify the relationship between the entities in Groucho Marx’s statement :                    I + elephant, I + pajamas, in + pajamas, elephant + pajamas, I + shot                    Answer: Relationship between two entities                 Not a relationship between two entities                     I + elephant, I + pajamas                    elephant + pajamas, I + shot                              in + pajamas                  After an AI has identified entities and relationships within text or               speech, it can start organising the information as part of its process               to  comprehend  it.  Interestingly,  your  brain  performs  a  similar               function, which may have assisted you in recognising entities and               relationships in the above AI Task. Consider the given sentence:               “Siddharth ate the sweet dish. He always eats first.” Notice the link               between the two parts of the sentence: the word ‘he’ is linked to               the term ‘Siddharth’. The system identifies this association using               understanding  and  linking  different  parts  of  the  text  known  as               coreference resolution. Coreference resolution is a crucial task in               NLP where the system determines when different words refer to               the same entity.               By recognising that ‘he’ refers to ‘Siddharth’, the AI can maintain coherence and context across sentences, much like how               humans understand and relate different parts of a conversation or text.                          370     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","A concept is an idea suggested or implied in a sentence but not actually stated.

Sentiment analysis is a text classification technique that               determines if subjective information is favourable, negative, or neutral.               Emotion detection employs machine learning to examine complicated               emotions such as fear, anger, sadness, love, and frustration.               At first look, sentiment analysis and emotion detection may appear               to be the same concept particularly for individuals without a scientific background. However, they are not synonyms, so               what is the difference between sentiment analysis and emotion detection?

Sentiment  analysis  focuses  on  the  overall  sentiment  expressed,  whereas  emotion  AI  seeks  to  distinguish  and               categorise distinct emotions. Thus, they work together to provide insights into the subjective components of human               communication.                         Classification Problem                In Natural Language Processing (NLP), classification problems include assigning a label or category to a piece of text,               sentence, or phrase based on its content. For example, Emails can be classified as spam or non-spam, tweets as positive               or negative, and articles as relevant or irrelevant to a specific topic.               Human language often includes terms that are vague or have multiple meanings. This leads to a classification problem.               Understanding these terms can be challenging, especially for AI systems that rely on context to accurately classify given               elements within sentences. Let us understand this with the help of an example. Consider the following statements:                     • He’s a really cool person. (Statement 1)                     • The weather today is cool. (Statement 2)                 In the above statements the phrases “cool person” and “cool weather” show the ambiguity of language, which poses a               classification problem. In statement 1, “cool person” can refer to someone who is admired for their style or demeanour.               Whereas in statement 2, a “cool temperature” refers to a lower, bearable level of heat. The challenge arises because the               word “cool” has been used in two different ways.               Just as with humans, it can be tricky for an AI system to correctly interpret these meanings without proper context. Let’s                        372     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","consider some additional examples:                         • You can bank on Ravi to finish the project on time. (bank here means rely on)                       • I need to go to the bank to deposit money. (here bank means a financial institution)                         • She likes to rock in her chair while reading. (move)                        • The band rocked the concert last night! (perform)                         • You can store files on a cloud. (online storage)                       • A cloud covers the sky. (weather phenomenon)                    It might only take you a moment to understand these different meanings, but an AI system could struggle with classifying                  these elements correctly without a comprehensive understanding of language nuances and context.                   Dealing with Classification Problems                  Classification can be more challenging for an AI system than simply identifying tokens because so much of classification                  depends on the context within the sentence.                  Compare:                         • I read a book about space. (outer space in universe)                       • I need space to work. (personal space)                    In both cases, the word “space” is used, but it has different meanings based on the context. An AI system must associate                  the word with the correct context: outer space or personal space.                  How does an AI system deal with this problem? Here are some ways:                                               AI systems use machine learning techniques, such as supervised learning.                          Dealing with Classification Problems                                                      The AI system learns patterns and links between words, sentences, and their                                                  meanings through a massive dataset of language usage and classification.                                                       The  AI  system  improves  classification  accuracy  over  time  by  modifying                                                  internal settings depending on observed patterns.                                              To overcome the level of uncertainity and error, well-designed AI systems not only                                          provide a response but also a confidence value, which indicates the system's degree                                          of assurance in its classification.

That's what a chatbot is! From ordering your favourite pizza to helping you               complete your homework, chatbots are revolutionising how we interact with technology.               Chatbots are software applications or computer programs that simulate conversation with human user, usually via text               or voice interactions. They use Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML)               techniques to interpret user inquiries and respond appropriately. Chatbots can be connected to a variety of platforms,               including  websites,  messaging  apps,  and  voice  assistants,  and  they  can  be  used  for  customer  service,  information               retrieval, task automation, and entertainment.

Structure of a Chatbot               A chatbot has both a “frontend” and a “backend”.               A chatbot’s frontend is the messaging channel through which users interact, and it has an easy-to-use interface.               However, one drawback of the frontend is that it may lack contextual understanding, which means it may struggle               to grasp the whole meaning or context of user communications. The backend of a chatbot is where the hard work               happens. The backend handles application logic and has enough memory to remember previous sections of the               discussion as it progresses.                                      FRONTEND                                            BACKEND                               Chatbots  understand  a  query  by  breaking  it  down  into  simpler  components  and  connecting  them  to  objects  in               their memory. A chatbot’s purpose is to recognise entities and intents and then use what it discovers to initiate a               communication.                 Intent               An intent is a purpose that explains why a user is contacting the chatbot. Consider it as a verb, or a type of activity.               When communicating with a chatbot, users may have a variety of intentions, such as registering a complaint, requesting               directions, or conversing with a sales representative. Organisations frequently have various intents for their chatbots to               address.                       376     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","For instance, assume you’re developing a chatbot for a hotel chain. A common user’s intent would be to ask about room                  availability. To ensure the chatbot can effectively handle this intent, you might ask a front desk agent who frequently                  answers these questions in person or over the phone. Your objective would be to compile a comprehensive list of the                  various ways guests might inquire about room availability. The table below includes different examples of potential user                  inputs related to this intent.

Entity                  An entity is a noun that represents a person, place, or thing. Once you’ve compiled a list of the intents you want your                  chatbot to satisfy, you proceed further. For instance, if a user asks, “Do you have any rooms available in Delhi?”, then                  checking room availability is the intent and Delhi is the entity. A chatbot requires a complete set of entities in order to                  be useful. The table below contains instances of entities that correspond to the intent and probable user inputs in the                  previous hotel example:                                    Intent                     Possible user inputs                  Entities                                                       Do you have any rooms available in   Location, Delhi                                                      Delhi?

Even if a human uses run-on sentences, poor grammar, chat               messaging expressions, and so on, then artificial intelligence allows the NLP to understand well enough to provide a               response.

Syntactic analysis, often known as parsing, is the act of examining grammar,               word arrangement, identifying word relationships and determining if the sentence make sense. The approach involves               examining all the words and phrases in a sentence as well as the structures that connect them.                  A syntax tree is created as part of the procedure to visually represent semantic links. This method ensures that the               structure,  sequence,  and  grammar  of  sentences  to  make  sense.  Syntactic  analysis  also  includes  tagging  words  and               sentences with POS (Parts of Speech) tags.

To properly analyse the               words  in a sentence for grammar, we use Syntactical parsing. Dependency Grammar and Part of Speech (POS)               tags  are  significant  syntactic  elements.  The  above  image  shows  the  correct  syntactical  parsing  of  words  done               during this stage.                Semantic Analysis                 Semantic analysis is the third stage of NLP, which aims at determining the appropriate meaning behind a statement in a               clear and concise manner. A semantic system integrates entities, concepts, relations, and predicates to add more context               to language, allowing machines to understand text data more accurately.                 Semantic analysis extracts meaning from language and serves as the foundation for a semantic system that aids robots               in interpreting meaning. This involves mapping the syntactic structure and ensuring that the presented relationships               between entities, words, phrases, and sentences in the text are logical.                         380     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","direction                                          Wrist Band                              Right                                               Band                                                                                                     Group of people                                                     correct                                          playing music                         In Natural Language, the meaning of a word may vary as per its usage in sentences and the context of the text.

For example, the word ‘Right’ may mean ‘direction’ or ‘correct.’                        Similarly the word ‘Band’ may mean ‘wrist band‘ or ‘a group of people playing music ‘ – hence, the accurate meaning                     of the word is highly dependent upon its context.                    Discourse Integration                    Discourse integration is the fourth phase of NLP, which essentially implies contextualisation. Discourse integration is                  the process of analysing and identifying the bigger context for a smaller section of natural language structure (such as                  a phrase, word, entity or sentence).                    During this phase, it is critical to ensure that each phrase, word, entity or sentence is mentioned in the proper context.                  This analysis considers sentence structure and semantics as well as sentence combination and overall text meaning.                  For example: Radha wants it.                    We can observe from the above sentence that the “it” keyword makes no sense. Hence, this statement is discarded. In                  reality, it applies to anything we don't know. Here \"it\" word depends on the prior sentence, which is not provided. So, if                  we know what \"it\" is, we can simply find the reference the girl is referring to.                                          Here its not clear what does Radha wants. It may be laptop, cake, headphone, or tablet. Its not specified what is 'it'                  referring to.                    Pragmatic Analysis                    Pragmatic analysis is the fifth and final stage of NLP. It is the process of abstracting or extracting meaning from the                  usage of language and interpreting a text using the knowledge obtained from previous NLP procedures. During this                  stage,  understanding  the  meaning  of  words  and  the  context  in  which  they  are  used  is  completed.  This  allows  for                  conversational functions between machines and humans (for example, chatbots). It translates the given text using the                  knowledge gathered in the preceding stages.

Sentiment analysis                  Generally, 80% of data is unstructured. That data needs to be analysed and used in a structured manner whether it is in                  the form of emails, texts, documents, articles, or anything else.                     Voice Assistants                  The use of voice assistants is growing in popularity. Almost everyone utilises                  a virtual assistant (like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant) for various tasks like                  making  calls,  setting  alarms,  scheduling  meetings,  making  notes,  and                  browsing the internet. How do they function? To comprehend and react to                  human speech, they employ a complex fusion of speech recognition, natural                  language processing, and natural language interpretation. The ultimate goal                  of voice assistants is to operate as an interface between people and the                  internet, offering a range of services using basic speech recognition.                                                           Email Filtering                                                        We all use email on a regular basis. We get bombarded with communications                                                        concerning our studies, careers, and other subjects. We receive emails from                                                        a wide range of sources; some are promotional while others are work-related                                                        or  from  our  ideal  organisation.

Data is               continuously being generated and needs to be properly kept, sorted, and               searched in various fields including businesses, institutions, and schools.               NLP has the potential to help with all of this. It saves us from the tiresome               and time-consuming chore of looking through numerous files for a single               person's information by not only searching a keyword but also categorising               it according to the guidelines. Not only that, it also helps users make well-               informed decisions on risk management and claims.

Short answer type questions.                        1.  When and why did IBM begin developing Project Debater?                      Ans.  In  2012,  IBM  began  developing  Project  Debater,  with  the  goal  of  creating  a  machine  capable  of  more  than                           just  winning  debates  with  humans.  IBM’s  goal  was  to  create  a  system  that  could  assist  individuals  in  making                           evidence-based, bias-free decisions on complex problems where the answers were not evident.                        2.  Define entity and relationship.                       Ans.  An entity can be real-world objects such as names, locations, organisations, or dates. They can also be defined as                           a noun representing a person, place, a thing such as product name, technical phrase, or domain-specific concepts.                           A relationship can be defined as a collection of two or more entities that share a strong bond with one another.                        3.  Differentiate between frontend and backend of a chatbot.                       Ans.  A chatbot’s frontend is the messaging channel through which users interact and it has an easy-to-use interface.                           However, one drawback of the frontend is that it may lack contextual understanding, which means it may struggle                           to grasp the whole meaning or context of user communications. The backend of a chatbot is where the hard work                           happens. The backend handles application logic and has enough memory to remember previous sections of a                           discussion as it progresses.                        4.   “Computers  excel  in  working  with  structured  data,  in  which  everything  is  properly  organised  and  labelled.                           Unfortunately for machines, human language is not structured.” What is so different about the human language?                      Ans.  Human language is extremely complex, with strange expressions that appear to contradict one another, vocabulary                           that  takes  cultural  knowledge  to  understand,  and  grammatical  patterns  that  may  turn  simple  statements  into                           complex expressions or tongue twisters.                         5.  Explain ‘concept’ with the help of an example.                      Ans.  A concept is an idea suggested or implied in a sentence but not actually stated. This is more challenging because                           it requires connecting underlying ideas rather than just the specific words used. For example, George Carlin said:                           “I went to a bookstore and asked the saleswoman, ‘Where’s the self-help section?’ She said if she told me, it would                           defeat the purpose.”                   B.

Explain discourse integration with an example.                    Ans.  Discourse integration is the process of analysing and identifying the bigger context for a smaller section of natural                         language structure (such as a phrase, word, entity or sentence). During this phase, it is critical to ensure that each                         phrase, word, entity, or sentence is mentioned in the proper context. This analysis considers sentence structure and                         semantics as well as sentence combination and overall text meaning.                         For example: Radha wants it.                         We can observe from the above sentence that the “it” keyword makes no sense. Hence, this statement is discarded.                         In reality, it applies to anything we don't know. Here \"it\" word depends on the prior sentence, which is not provided.                       392     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","5.   “A syntax tree is created as part of the procedure to visually represent semantic links.” Identify the phase of NLP                           processing.                                                                     [CBSE Handbook]                      Ans.  The phase of NLP processing that involves the creation of a syntax tree to visually represent semantic links is                           the Syntactical Analysis phase.                           In syntactical analysis, the aim is to check the grammar, word layouts, and word relationships in a given text. One of                           the key tasks in this phase is to create a syntax tree, also known as a parse tree, which represents the grammatical                           structure of the sentence and visually displays the relationships between words. This helps in understanding the                           syntactical constructs and semantic relationships within the text, thereby aiding in the overall comprehension and                           analysis of the language.

In “EduTech University”, Professor Geeta envisioned an AI, capable of debating with human-like depth and knowledge.                           This idea sparked “Project Debator”, motivated by a desire to enhance public discourse through unbiased, well-                           researched arguments.                              Professor Geeta wanted the AI to access vast information, articulate points clearly, and anticipate counter arguments.                           She also envisioned the AI model to learn from interactions, analyse emotional tones, and provide feedback to                           improve users' debating skills. With this vision, she and her team embarked on developing “Project Debator” to                           revolutionise how people think, argue, and understand the world. What features would you like to add on from                           your side, apart from features envisioned by Professor Geeta?                       Ans.  Professor Geeta's Project Debater aims to create an AI for unbiased debate by providing well-researched arguments,                           clear communication, and the ability to learn and adapt. To this, you propose adding features like:                           •   Creative argument approaches using metaphors and storytelling.                           •   Contextual understanding to tailor arguments for specific audiences.                           •   Real-time fact-checking for extra credibility.                           •   Fallacy detection to counter illogical arguments.                         2.   A ground-breaking AI project was underway at the esteemed “SoftCo Labs”. Dr. Madhavi, the lead researcher, was                           deep in thought as she looked over her team's latest developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP). They                           had successfully integrated sentiment analysis into their system, but now faced a crucial decision: should they treat                           sentiment analysis and emotion detection as separate units?                            Gathering her team, Dr Madhavi posed a critical question. \"Imagine our AI, Ava, navigating the complex world                           of human interaction. What reasons would justify us dividing sentiment analysis and emotion detection into two                           distinct units of NLP?\"                            As her team pondered this, they knew they had to consider various factors to ensure Ava could understand and                           respond to human communication with the utmost accuracy and empathy. What reasons would they come up with                           to support Dr. Madhavi's proposition?                      Ans.  Sentiment analysis and emotion detection are two Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that use human                           language to categorise people's thoughts, attitudes, and feelings. Sentiment analysis is a text classification task                           that determines if subjective information is favourable, negative, or neutral. Emotion detection employs machine                           learning to examine complicated emotions such as fear, anger, sadness, love, and frustration.                           At first look, Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Emotion Detection (ED) may appear to be the same concept particularly                           for individuals without a scientific background. However, they are not synonyms, a simple distinction would be                           that emotion detection tells the emotion where as sentiment analysis detects the intensity. Emotion detection                           understands the tokens for emotions where as sentiment analysis looks for the tone to identify the feelings.

It powers navigation apps, helping you find the best or most               eco-friendly routes. It enhances the capability of search engines, making it easier to find the information you need. It               assists doctors in making accurate diagnoses and developing better treatment plans. It improves weather forecasting,               so you can be prepared for major weather events. Combined with sensors and satellites, it collects data about the               environment, helps scientists in understanding and predicting the changes in our world. AI makes life easier and safer               by helping people to make informed decisions, connecting them with the right information at the right time, and               identifying patterns or efficiencies they might miss.                But AI can also cause harm. For instance, AI can be used to decide who gets a loan, who gets into college, who gets a               job, how much employees are paid, or how long prison sentences should be. The harm from AI isn’t always physical.               It can be less obvious, like unfairness, discrimination, or exclusion. This harm can be subtle because people might not               know when they are interacting with AI or how it is affecting decisions about them.               AI is the product of human imagination. Prejudice or bias, whether we are willing to admit it or not, is inherent in               human  experience.  To  avoid  prejudice,  programmers  can  turn  to  the  philosophical  basis  of  asking  questions  out               of curiosity, seeking to transcend our own perspectives, and learning to see the world outside the trap of our own               human algorithms. Machines are everywhere and they learn from humans. Since all humans have certain ethics and               biases based on the environment and cultures they are surrounded by, machines also learn the ethics and biases from               humans.               As Artificial Intelligence (AI) evolves towards a stage where it can replicate human brain capabilities. The development               of intelligent machines raises some ethical concerns. To make people aware about AI machines, some ethical guidelines               have been developed. These guidelines ensure that AI machines are not harmful to humans or society.                         400     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Task                                                       #Digital Literacy                         Scan the QR code or go to the link to watch the video and answer the question given below:                      AI is Monitoring You Right Now and Here’s How It's Using Your Data                      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpybityrXfs                      After  watching  the  video,  answer  the  following  question:  From  where  do  computer  forecasting  systems                      collect data?                      __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________                              Ethics in Artificial Intelligence                    AI ethics is a set of moral principles and practices designed to support the development and responsible use of AI                  technology.

Nowadays, we can easily get huge amounts of data, and it keeps growing. When Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data                  work together, they find patterns and help us make decisions, thus, making life easier. But AI also brings challenges                  and ethical risks that we cannot ignore.                  Sometimes, technology focuses only on what is easy to measure, ignoring how people feel. This can give a false sense                  of security. Technology should respect human values and rights as well as focus on what is best for people. So, there                  should be rules or guidelines for ethical AI.                  When designing AI systems, we should prioritise the well-being of the people who use them considering their mental,                  physical, and social health.                  AI ethics is important for the following reasons:                     • As Artificial Intelligence becomes more integrated into our lives, and has the potential to impact various aspects                    of society, including privacy, employment, and decision-making. Ensuring that AI systems are developed and used                    ethically helps prevent harm to individuals and communities.                     • Ethical  AI  promotes  fairness  and  equity.  Without  proper  guidelines,  AI  algorithms  may  unintentionally  reinforce                    biases or discriminate against certain groups of people. Ethical considerations help mitigate these risks and ensure                    that AI systems treat everyone fairly.                     • AI ethics fosters trust and accountability. When people trust that AI technologies are designed and used responsibly,                    they are more likely to accept and adopt them. Ethical guidelines also hold developers and users accountable for the                    consequences of AI systems, encouraging responsible behaviour and decision-making.                  AI ethics is important for creating a future where artificial intelligence benefits society while respecting human values,                  rights, and well-being.                           The Five Pillars of AI Ethics                    AI ethics is a multidisciplinary field focused on maximising the positive effects of AI while minimising unintended                  or negative consequences. The core principles of AI ethics are fairness, robustness, explainability, transparency, and                  privacy. These areas of focus are essential for ensuring the trustworthiness of AI.                   Fairness                  Fairness is a crucial aspect of ethics in AI because it ensures that AI systems treat all individuals                  and groups equitably and without bias. In AI, fairness means that the outcomes produced by                  algorithms  do  not  disproportionately  harm  or  advantage  specific  demographics  based  on                  characteristics such as race, gender, religion, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.                  Example: A hiring algorithm used by a company must evaluate candidates solely based on their                  qualifications and experience, without being influenced by gender, race, or age.                                      Explainability                                     Explainability  in  AI  is  crucial  for  ensuring  that  the  decisions  made  by  AI  systems  are                                     understandable to humans. It pertains to the transparency and clarity of AI systems, enabling                                     users  to  understand  the  decision-making  process  and  forecasts  of  algorithms.  It  facilitates                                     stakeholders in comprehending the fundamental reasoning, elements, and factors influencing                                     algorithmic  results,  promoting  confidence,  responsibility,  and  ethical  application  of  AI                  technologies. The essence of explainability lies in guaranteeing that AI systems are open, answerable, and in harmony                  with ethical standards.                                                                                             AI Ethics and Values   403","Example: Imagine you’re using a smart algorithm to determine who gets a loan. If the algorithm denies someone               a loan, they have the right to know why. Explainable AI provides this explanation, helping people understand how               decisions are made and why certain outcomes occur.                Robustness               Robustness in AI ethics refers to the capacity of AI systems to perform reliably and accurately               across various conditions, while minimising unintended consequences and harmful impacts. It is               a fundamental aspect of ethical AI because unreliable or biased systems can lead to significant               societal harm. Robustness in AI systems implies their ability to deliver precise and dependable               outcomes under various circumstances and for longer periods. It ensures that AI algorithms               and  systems  function  as  intended  without  facing  unforeseen  errors  or  deviating  from  their               designated behaviour.               Example: Self-driving cars need to be robust to operate safely in various weather conditions and road scenarios. A               robust AI system in a self-driving car should be able to correctly identify and respond to pedestrians in both clear and               foggy conditions.                                    Transparency                                  Transparency in AI means being open and clear about how AI systems are created, how they                                  work, and what impacts they might have. It involves providing straightforward information about                                  the  data,  algorithms,  and  decision-making  processes  used  in  AI  applications.  This  openness                                  encourages accountability, allows for scrutiny, and helps people to make informed choices about                                  the ethical and social implications of AI technologies.               Example: Social media platforms using AI to moderate content should disclose the criteria and algorithms they use               to flag or remove posts. If a platform removes content for hate speech, it should clearly explain the rules and the AI’s               decision-making process to the users.                Privacy               Privacy  involves  individuals  having  control  over  their  personal  information  and  avoiding               unwarranted interference in their lives. It encompasses the right to keep aspects of one's life               private, such as private messages, activities, and data. Privacy is crucial as it safeguards individual               autonomy, dignity, and freedom from unnecessary intrusion.               Example: An AI-powered personal assistant, like Siri or Alexa, should ensure that users’ voice               recordings and personal data are kept secure and not misused. These assistants should not store or share sensitive               information without explicit user consent, and data encryption should be used to protect user privacy.                                                                                         #Creativity and Innovativeness                            Video Session                       Watch the video on AI FOR GOOD - Ethics in AI and answer the question asked:                      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgUWKXVvO9Q                      Elaborate on the statement: “We need to choose how we use AI, or else AI will choose how to use us.”                      _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________                      _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________                            404     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Reboot                         1.

Bias, Bias Awareness, AI Bias and Sources of Bias                    A facial recognition algorithm might find it easier to identify a white person compared to a dark complexion person                  due to the prevalence of white faces in the training data. This discrepancy can unfairly impact individuals from distinct                  groups, reinforcing inequality and oppression. The challenge lies in the unintentional nature of these biases, which                  often go unnoticed until they manifest in the software.                    Bias                  Bias is defined as prejudice against individuals or groups, especially in                  ways that are considered unfair. “Bias in AI” has long been a key area                  of research and attention in the machine learning community. It refers                  to situations where ML-based data analysis systems are biased against                  certain  groups  of  people.  These  biases  usually  reflect  the  prevailing                  social  biases  related to  race, gender,  biological  sex, age, and culture.                  AI systems learn to make decisions based on training data, which may                  include biased human decisions or reflect historical or social inequities.                   Bias Awareness                  In today’s connected world, AI technologies are becoming more important in different areas of our lives, such as                  healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. However, as AI systems become more common, it’s crucial to recognise and                  address the biases they may have. Bias awareness means understanding that AI systems can show unfair preferences                  due to factors like training data used to train the AI models, rules they follow, the algorithms they use, or the principles                  with which the AI model was designed. This awareness involves understanding that AI may occasionally make biased                  decisions because of how AI model was developed or trained.

(State True or False)                                                                AI Bias                                                        AI bias  is  a  phenomenon  that  occurs  when  algorithm  results  are                                                        systematically biased against a certain gender, language, race, wealth,                                                        etc.  AI  bias  leads  to  a  skewed  output.  Algorithms  can  have  inherent                                                        biases  because  AI  models  are  created  by  individuals  with  conscious                                                        or unconscious preferences, and these preferences, which may not be                                                        discovered until the algorithm is used publicly (as we saw in the case of                                                        the hand dispenser and Google’s photo tagging algorithm).                Bias is one of the biggest challenges facing AI. Although all programmers try to have absolute factual data, there is               an inevitable bias when exploring the depth to which AI can be used. An inherent problem with AI systems is that               they are as good or as bad as the trained data. Bad data usually carries racial, gender, community, or ethnic biases in               algorithms responsible for critical decisions go unrecognised, they can lead to unethical and unfair consequences. In               the future, these biases may worsen, especially as many AI recruitment systems will continue to use incorrect data for               training. Therefore, there is an urgent need to train these systems with unbiased data and to develop algorithms that               are easy to interpret.                Sources of Bias               Data bias happens when some parts of a dataset are given too much               weight or are over-represented implying the dataset doesn’t accurately               reflect  what  the  machine  learning  model  is  meant  to  do,  leading  to               unfair outcomes and poor accuracy.                Often,  biased  outcomes  often  result  in  discriminate  against  certain               groups of people, such as those based on age, race, culture, or sexual               orientation. As AI systems become more common, the risk of data bias               is that it can amplify existing discrimination. To prevent any ambiguity               or reduce the biasness, it is important to identify the source of bias and               take the necessary steps.               Addressing AI bias involves thorough examination of datasets, machine learning algorithms, and other elements of AI               systems to identify sources of potential bias.                      406     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Training Data Bias                  Training  data  bias  occurs  when  the  data  used  to  develop  AI  systems  is                  unrepresentative, incomplete, or skewed. If the data reflects existing prejudices                  or excludes certain groups, the AI system may learn and perpetuate these biases.                  AI systems make decisions based on data they are trained on, so it is crucial to                  check datasets for bias. One way to do this is to examine whether certain groups                  are over- or under-represented in the data. For example, a medical AI system                  trained on data from male patients may not perform well for female patients,                  leading to misdiagnoses.                  Similarly, an AI system used for loan approvals might be biased if the training                  data primarily includes applicants from affluent neighbourhoods, disregarding those from poorer areas. Bias can also                  occur in data labelling.                                                   Algorithmic Bias                                                 Algorithmic bias refers to the bias that may exist in the design, implementation,                                                 and outcomes of algorithms used in AI systems. This bias can result in unfair or                                                 discriminatory outcomes, often reflecting the prejudices or limitations of the data                                                 used to train the algorithm, as well as the assumptions and decisions made by                                                 developers during the algorithm’s creation.                                                 For example, if an AI algorithm used in hiring processes is trained on historical                                                 data  that  reflects  biased  hiring  decisions,  such  as  favouring  one  demographic                                                 group over another, the algorithm may perpetuate these biases when making new                                                 hiring recommendations.                  Addressing algorithmic bias requires careful consideration of the data used to train algorithms, as well as transparency                  and accountability in the design and implementation processes. Techniques such as bias detection, fairness-aware                  algorithms, and diverse data collection can help mitigate algorithmic bias and promote more equitable outcomes in                  AI systems.                    Cognitive Bias                  Cognitive bias refers to systematic patterns of deviation from rationality or objectivity                  in judgment or decision-making. These biases are often influenced by factors such                  as emotions, personal experiences, and social norms, leading individuals to make                  judgments or decisions that may not be entirely rational or impartial.                  For example, imagine a person who strongly believes that climate change is not real.                  When presented with scientific evidence supporting climate change, they might                  dismiss it or interpret it in a way that aligns with their preconceived notion, while                  ignoring or downplaying evidence to the contrary. This individual’s confirmation                  bias  prevents  them  from  objectively  considering  added  information  and  may                  reinforce their existing beliefs, even in the face of contradictory evidence.                  Cognitive biases can impact various aspects of life, including personal relationships, business decisions, and societal                  perceptions. Recognising and understanding these biases is essential for making more informed and rational decisions,                  both individually and collectively. Strategies such as critical thinking, mindfulness, and seeking diverse perspectives                  can help mitigate the influence of cognitive biases.                                                                                             AI Ethics and Values   407","AI Bias in Real Life               AI bias in real life means that the decisions made by AI systems are not always fair or accurate because they are               influenced  by  biases.  Just  like  people,  AI  systems  can  make  unfair  decisions  if  they  are  trained  on  biased  data  or               programmed with biased rules.                               Brainy Fact                       Tay  was  an  Artificial  Intelligence  Chatbot  that  was  originally  launched  by  Microsoft                     Corporation on Twitter on March 23, 2016. When the bot started posting inflammatory                     and offensive tweets through its Twitter account, it caused a subsequent controversy,                     prompting Microsoft to shut down the service just 16 hours after its launch. According                     to Microsoft, this was caused by trolls that \"attacked\" the service, as the bot's responses                     were based on its interaction with people on Twitter.                  Healthcare               AI  model  utilised  for  medical  diagnosis  can  be  biased  if  there  is  an  over-representation  of  one               demographic group in the training data compared to another. For example, an AI system for melanoma               detection (a skin disease) trained primarily on fair skinned individuals may not perform well for darker               skinned ones, thus leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment.                                Education                               Drafting essays or grading standardised tests with AI can discriminate against test takers based on                               culture, dialect, or the way of writing. Failure to recognise cultural expressions and languages may                               unfairly disadvantage students from specific regions.                Finance               Biased training data or attributes may inadvertently lead some AI algorithms used in credit scoring to               discriminate against certain demographics. For instance, if historical loan approving data has prejudice               lending  practices  patterns,  then  AIs  trained  on  such  models  might  initiate  them  hence  making  it               difficult for lower-level communities to have equal access to loans.

For instance, because past cases                               disproportionately target people from certain races or socio-economic classes, this might result into                               categorising many people from these groups as high risks thereby leading to unfairness in sentencing                               procedures.

If a person is white, the result is very good. The                    drawback is that the most popular paintings of this era were of European whites. So, the database consists                    of mainly white people and an algorithm that relies on the same database tends to make you look ‘fairer’                    while drawing your image.                       408     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","Mitigating Bias in AI Systems                    Artificial Intelligence bias is the result of human biases, as people select the training data for machine learning algorithms                  and determine how the algorithm’s results should be applied. Therefore, people must advocate for ethical AI and find                  ways  to  mitigate  bias.  Data science  leaders,  policymakers,  and  other  key  stakeholders  are  now  prioritising  ways  to                  mitigate bias and limit the potentially negative impacts of automated decisions in real-world applications.                  There are several reasons to alleviate bias in AI systems. First, when you have a bias in your AI system, you amplify                  whatever problems you have. Unfairness and discrimination are bad on their own, and when you add an AI system                  on top of them, they get worse. For instance, using biased algorithms for hiring can disadvantage certain groups and                  perpetuate systemic discrimination. Second, when AI systems are biased, people lose trust in technology. If you don’t                  trust your AI system to behave fairly towards you, you may choose not to interact with it at all. And this can be detrimental                  not only to you but to everyone. Finally, we strive to tackle bias because it’s inherent to certain ethical principles and we                  want to ensure AI systems are developed and used responsibly.                   Strategies for Mitigating Bias                  There are several strategies and techniques for mitigating bias in AI systems:                      • Ethical Guidelines and Policies: Formulate ethical guidelines and policies   Ethical Guidelines and Policies                    to  ensure  fairness  and  mitigate  biases  in  decision-making.  Always  keep                    provisions for regular review and update of guidelines to address new issues.  Diverse Data                      • Diverse Data:  To  reduce  bias,  we  should  use  lots  of  different  kinds  of                    information to teach AI. So, AI can learn from many different examples and   Data Transparency and Quality                    viewpoints, making it less likely to be biased.                     • Data Transparency and Quality: By maintaining transparency of the data   Bias Testing and Auditing                    inputs that are fed into the decision-making process and maintaining data                    quality by continuously checking data sources for potential biases.    Algorithmic Fairness                     • Bias Testing and Auditing:  Regularly  conduct  testing  and  auditing  to                    identify biases in algorithms, models, or decision-making processes. This   Accountability and Transparency                    should be done regularly, and systems updated to mitigate biases detected.                                                                                           Feedback Mechanisms                     • Algorithmic Fairness:  We  can  make  AI  systems  fairer  by  using  special                    algorithms  that  are  designed  to  be  fair.  These  algorithms  make  sure  to   Continuous Improvement                    consider fairness when making decisions, helping to reduce bias.                     • Accountability and Transparency: Ensure accountability of decision makers for their decisions and potential biases.                      • Feedback Mechanisms:  Create  feedback  mechanisms  that  allow  stakeholders  to  flag  potential  biases  in  the                    decision-making  process.  Actively  seek  and  consider  feedback  from  stakeholders  to  mitigate  biases  and  ensure                    fairness and inclusiveness.                      • Continuous Improvement: Regularly evaluate decision-making processes for biases and establish mechanisms for                    continuous improvement based on feedback, data, and emerging research.                          Developing AI Policies                    Creating rules for AI is crucial to ensure its ethical and fair use. Clear guidelines are necessary regarding the deployment                  of AI, with consideration given to everyone's input in the rule-making process. Before using AI, we should check for                  any problems and have plans to fix them.

It is a set of ethical principles that                  regulate the behaviour and actions of individuals or groups. Artificial Intelligence ethics is a part of ethical technology                  specific to robots and other artificially intelligent machines. Several ethical concerns regarding AI include:                      • If AI produces human-like results, can it also take human-like decisions?                     • If AI decides whether to grant bank loans, will the AI algorithms be fair and just?                     • If AI makes human decisions, is it also worthy of human confidence?                     • AI is basically data + mathematical model + data-based training + prediction. What if the data provided for training                    is unintentionally skewed or biased?                     • Will AI lead to significant job displacement?

Resolving ethical dilemmas requires thoughtful consideration of the consequences of different actions and balancing               conflicting ethical concerns.               Example:                   • Scenario: You work for a pharmaceutical company developing a new drug to treat a rare disease. During clinical                  trials, it becomes evident that the drug is effective in treating the disease, but it also has significant side effects in a                  small percentage of patients. The company is under pressure to release the drug quickly due to the urgent need for                  treatment, but there are concerns about the potential harm caused by the side effects.                  • Ethical Dilemma: On one hand, releasing the drug could provide relief to patients suffering from the rare disease,                  potentially saving lives, and improving quality of life.

If they are feeling creative, people can also design their own scenarios for others to                  view, share, and discuss.                  The Moral Machine shows you different situations that make you think about what’s right and wrong. For instance,                  picture yourself driving a self-driving car. Suddenly, it faces a tough choice: should it swerve to avoid hitting people                  on the street, even if it puts the passengers in danger, or stay on track and risk hurting those outside? What would                  you do? And why?                  The  situations  on  the  Moral  Machine  might  not  be  real,  but  they  mirror  actual  ethical  problems  that  AI  makers,                  government people, and everyone else need to think about. As AI gets better and more common, we must talk about                  the right and wrong ways to use it. The Moral Machine helps start those conversations, making people more aware                  and ethical when it comes to AI.                                                                                          #Experiential Learning                                       GAME         01                     Moral Machine                         This platform is based on Machine Learning which shows the machine intelligence in making moral decisions.

The five pillars of AI ethics are fairness, robustness, explainability, transparency, and privacy. The description of each                           are as follows:                           •   Fairness: Fairness is a crucial aspect of ethics in AI because it ensures that AI systems treat all individuals and                              groups equitably and without bias. In AI, fairness means that the outcomes produced by algorithms do not                              disproportionately harm or advantage specific demographics based on characteristics such as race, gender,                              religion, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.                           •   Explainability: Explainability in AI is crucial for ensuring that the decisions made by AI systems are understandable                              to  humans.  It  pertains  to  the  transparency  and  clarity  of  AI  systems,  enabling  users  to  understand  the                              decision-making process and forecasts of algorithms.                           •   Robustness: Robustness in AI ethics refers to the capacity of AI systems to perform reliably and accurately across                              various conditions, while also minimising unintended consequences and harmful impacts. It is a fundamental                              aspect of ethical AI because unreliable or biased systems can lead to significant societal harm.                           •   Transparency: Transparency in AI means being open and clear about how AI systems are created, how they                              work, and what impacts they might have. It involves providing straightforward information about the data,                              algorithms, and decision-making processes used in AI applications. This openness encourages accountability,                              allows for scrutiny, and helps people make informed choices about the ethical and social implications of AI                              technologies.                            •   Privacy: Privacy involves individuals having control over their personal information and avoiding unwarranted                              interference in their lives. It encompasses the right to keep aspects of one's life private, such as private messages,                              activities, and data. Privacy is crucial as it safeguards individual autonomy, dignity, and freedom from unnecessary                              intrusion.                        2.  Discuss the concept of the ethical dilemma with an example.                      Ans.  An ethical dilemma is a situation in which a person faces a choice between conflicting moral principles or values. It                           often involves tough decisions where there are competing interests or where doing what is considered right may                           result in undesirable outcomes. Ethical dilemmas can arise in various contexts, such as in personal relationships,                           professional  settings,  or  societal  issues.  Resolving  ethical  dilemmas  requires  thoughtful  consideration  of  the                           consequences of different actions and balancing conflicting ethical concerns.                           Let us understand the concept of ethical dilemma with the help of an example.                           Scenario: You work for a pharmaceutical company developing a new drug to treat a rare disease. During clinical                           trials, it becomes evident that the drug is effective in treating the disease, but it also has significant side effects in                           a small percentage of patients. The company is under pressure to release the drug quickly due to the urgent need                           for treatment, but there are concerns about the potential harm caused by the side effects.                             Ethical Dilemma: On one hand, releasing the drug could provide relief to patients suffering from the rare disease,                           potentially saving lives, and improving quality of life. On the other hand, there’s a risk of causing harm to patients                           due to the side effects, which could lead to serious health complications or even fatalities.                         3.  Explain the different sources of bias in AI systems and how they can lead to unfair outcomes.                      Ans.  Bias in AI systems can stem from several sources, including training data bias, algorithmic bias, and cognitive bias.                           •   Training data bias: This occurs when the data used to train AI systems is unrepresentative, incomplete, or                              skewed. For instance, if a medical AI system is trained primarily on data from male patients, it may not perform                              well for female patients, leading to misdiagnoses. Similarly, an AI used for loan approvals might be biased if it                              primarily includes applicants from affluent neighbourhoods, thereby ignoring applicants from poorer areas.                           •   Algorithmic bias: This type of bias arises during the design and implementation of algorithms. If an AI hiring                              algorithm is trained on historical data that reflects biased hiring decisions, such as favouring one demographic                              group over another, the algorithm may perpetuate these biases in new hiring recommendations.                                                                                             AI Ethics and Values   419","•   Cognitive bias: This refers to systematic patterns of deviation from rationality or objectivity in judgement,                           influenced by factors like emotions and personal experiences. For example, a person who strongly believes that                           climate change is not real might dismiss scientific evidence supporting it, thus reinforcing their existing beliefs.                           Cognitive biases can lead to irrational or partial judgements, impacting AI development and application.                        Each of these biases can result in AI systems that unfairly discriminate against certain groups, leading to unethical                        and unfair outcomes in various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice.                C.   Competency-based/Application-based questions:                      1.   Aditi, a young entrepreneur, applies for a business loan to expand her small enterprise. She has an excellent credit                         score, a solid business plan, and a history of successful repayments. However, the bank she approaches uses an AI                         system to evaluate loan applications. This AI system was trained primarily on data from affluent urban areas and                         does not consider factors relevant to Aditi’s rural context.                        Despite her strong qualifications, the AI system flags her application as high risk because the training data does not                        adequately represent rural entrepreneurs. As a result, Aditi’s loan application is denied, and she is unable to expand                        her business. What are the potential consequences of using biased AI systems in financial services, and how can                        such biases be addressed to ensure fair treatment of all applicants?                    Ans.  Using biased AI systems in financial services can lead to unfair treatment of certain groups, such as rural entrepreneurs                        like: Aditi. This can result in qualified applicants being denied opportunities, perpetuating economic disparities.                        To address such biases:                        •     Inclusive data collection: Ensure the training data includes diverse representations from various demographics,                           including rural areas. This helps the AI system to learn patterns that are applicable to a broader range of applicants.                        •   Bias detection and correction: Implement algorithms that detect and correct biases during the evaluation                           process. This can involve techniques such as fairness constraints and bias mitigation strategies.                        •   Human oversight: Complement AI assessments with human judgement to catch and mitigate unfair decisions.                           Loan officers can review flagged applications to ensure qualified candidates are not unjustly denied.                        •   Transparency: Make the AI decision-making process transparent so applicants understand why their applications                           are  accepted  or  denied.  Providing  clear  reasons  for  decisions  can  help  build  trust  and  allow  applicants  to                           address any specific issues.                        Assertion and Reasoning Questions:                          Direction: Questions 2-4, consist of two statements – Assertion (A) and Reasoning (R). Answer these questions                        by selecting the appropriate option given below:                        a. Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.                        b. Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A.                        c. A is true but R is false.                        d. A is false but R is true.                    2.   Assertion (A): AI is considered one of the best tools for predicting weather and other natural events.                        Reasoning (R): Real-time data analysis helps farmers to improve their crop yields and in turn their profits too.                    3.   Assertion (A): AI cannot help too much in cyber security.                        Reasoning (R):  By learning patterns frequently used by hackers and creating hierarchical security for the system,                                      using Artificial Intelligence for network security can significantly improve and ensure transaction                                      security.                    4.  Assertion(A): Transparency and explainability are crucial in AI systems to promote trust and accountability.                        Reasoning(R):  Transparency ensures that users understand how AI systems make decisions, while explainability                                     provides insight into the reasoning behind those decisions. This promotes trust by allowing users                                     to verify the fairness and reliability of AI systems. Additionally, accountability is enhanced when                                     the decision-making process is transparent, as it enables stakeholders to identify and address any                                     biases or errors in the AI system.

Rahul works for a company that uses autonomous drones to deliver packages in urban areas. One day, a drone                           encounters a malfunction while navigating through a busy city street. The drone’s AI must choose between making                           an emergency landing in a park, where children are playing, or on a deserted road, risking damage to the drone and                           its package.                            The drone, programmed to minimise human harm, attempts to land on the deserted road but crashes into a parked                           car, causing significant damage. The car owner, upset by the incident, demands accountability from the drone                           company.                           In  the  case  of  the  drone’s  malfunction,  who  should  be  held  accountable  for  the  damage,  and  what  ethical                           considerations should guide the development of autonomous systems to handle such scenarios?                           Assertion and Reasoning Questions:                             Direction: Questions 2-3, consist of two statements – Assertion (A) and Reasoning (R). Answer these questions                           by selecting the appropriate option given below:                           a. Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.                           b. Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A.                           c.

Assertion(A): Bias in AI systems can lead to unfair outcomes and perpetuate social inequalities.                           Reasoning(R):  AI systems make decisions based on the data they are trained on, and if this data reflects societal                                        biases or prejudices, the AI may replicate and amplify these biases in its decision-making process.                                        This can result in unfair treatment of certain groups, exacerbating existing inequalities in areas such                                        as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice.                       3.   Assertion (A): Inputting skewed data into the system leads to AI bias.                           Reasoning (R): AI systems never are as good as the data we feed them.

My Drawings Speak Up (Palestine)                        A young student saw a friend being bullied at school but was afraid to speak out. She realised that a student's                        drawing can often express what he or she is experiencing in life.                        Therefore, she developed a solution to identify and support students who have experienced                        violence and bullying. She and her mother teamed up to create ‘My Drawings Speak Up’, an                        app that utilises machine learning to examine drawings to determine if a child is experiencing                        violence.

Emotion Detector For Angry Players (Spain)                        Have you noticed that while playing video games, your emotions run free? You most probably have become                        angry and aggressive. A group of Spanish middle school boys who call themselves ‘Happy Llamas’ realised                        that even after the game is over, the negative emotions they experience while playing video games continue                        to  hurt  their  emotional  state.  Therefore,  they  developed  ‘Emotion  Detector  for  Angry  Players’,  a  mobile                        application  that  uses  image  gesture  recognition  to  indicate  when  players  experience  healthy  (calm)  or                        unhealthy (angry) emotions. When the app detects any emotion, it notifies the player by displaying the                        shades between green (calm) and red (anger). This indicator helps the players regulate their emotions while                        playing.

Share the following examples of biased AI systems and their potential consequences and ask students to do a role play                    to present each scenario:                     Social Media Algorithms:                       ●   Example:  Algorithms  on  social  media  platforms  often  prioritise  content  based  on  user  engagement  metrics,                          leading to echo chambers and reinforcing existing biases and opinions.                       ●   Consequences: Biased social media algorithms can contribute to polarisation and the spread of misinformation,                          undermining democratic discourse and social cohesion.                     Loan Approval Systems:                       ●   Example: Automated loan approval systems used by banks may use biased criteria that favour certain demographic                          groups over others, leading to disparities in access to credit.                       ●   Consequences:  Biased  loan  approval  algorithms  can  perpetuate  financial  exclusion  and  deepen  economic                          inequality, particularly for marginalised communities who may already face barriers to financial resources.                     Criminal Sentencing Algorithms:                       ●   Example: Some jurisdictions use algorithms to assist judges in determining sentencing decisions based on factors                          such as criminal history and offense severity. However, these algorithms have been found to exhibit racial biases.                       ●   Consequences: Biased sentencing algorithms may result in harsher punishments for individuals from minority                          groups, contributing to mass incarceration and perpetuating systemic injustice within the criminal justice system.                    School Admissions Algorithms:                        ●   Example: Educational institutions may use algorithms to assist in the admissions process, considering factors like                          academic performance and extracurricular activities. However, these algorithms may unintentionally disadvantage                          students from underprivileged backgrounds.                        ●  Consequences: Biased admissions algorithms can limit educational opportunities for disadvantaged students,                          widening the achievement gap and hindering social mobility.                                                 426     Touchpad Artificial Intelligence (Ver. 3.0)-XI","PART-C                                 PRACTICAL WORK                                                                         \&                                      PROJECT WORK                                                                                                                                                         Projects    427","","Practical Questions                                                                                               #Coding \& Computational Thinking                  1.

We use np.random.normal to generate normal distributions for these features. StandardScaler is               used to standardize the features to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Then we initialize and               fit the K-means algorithm with 3 clusters. Lastly, we create a scatter plot of ‘Annual Income’ vs. ‘Loan Amount’, coloured               by cluster assignment.)               26.

Though AI has gained a lot of popularity, there are still various ethical concerns surrounding it: Explain.   4                     20.  Consider the given scenario and answer the following questions:                                 4                        A technology company has been contracted to develop a sophisticated facial recognition system intended for                        law enforcement applications. This system is designed to assist in identifying suspects by matching their facial                        features against a database. Initially recognised for its high level of accuracy and efficiency in processing and                        identifying faces, the system, however, has come under scrutiny after reports emerged that it disproportionately                        misidentifies people of colour. Investigations revealed that the misidentification rate for individuals of colour was                        significantly higher than for white individuals, leading to a higher incidence of wrongful detentions and arrests                        among these communities. Further analysis indicated that the training data used to develop the algorithm lacked                        sufficient diversity, predominantly featuring the faces of white individuals. This oversight has not only raised                        questions about the racial bias inherent in AI technologies but also about the ethical implications of deploying                        such systems in sensitive areas like law enforcement without thorough vetting for fairness and impartiality.                         a) What ethical problems are evident in this scenario?                        b) What is one ethical approach to mitigate the bias found in the facial recognition system without                          compromising its accuracy?                        c)  How does the lack of diversity in training data contribute to the problem of algorithmic bias in this scenario?                        d) What measures can be taken to ensure that the deployment of AI systems in law enforcement is both ethical                          and effective?                     21.
